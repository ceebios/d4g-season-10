      "UK Biobank is a health resource with data from over 500,000 adults. The cognitive assessment in UK Biobank is brief and bespoke, and is administered without supervision on a touchscreen computer. Psychometric information on the UK Biobank cognitive tests are limited. Despite the non-standard nature of these tests and the limited psychometric information, the UK Biobank cognitive data have been used in numerous scientific publications. The present study examined the validity and short-term test-retest reliability of the UK Biobank cognitive tests. A sample of 160 participants (mean age = 62.59, SD = 10.24) was recruited who completed the UK Biobank cognitive assessment and a range of well-validated cognitive tests (\u2018reference tests\u2019). Fifty-two participants returned 4 weeks later to repeat the UK Biobank tests. Correlations were calculated between UK Biobank tests and reference tests. Two measures of general cognitive ability were created by entering scores on the UK Biobank cognitive tests, and scores on the reference tests, respectively, into separate principal component analyses and saving scores on the first principal component. Four-week test-retest correlations were calculated for UK Biobank tests. UK Biobank cognitive tests showed a range of correlations with their respective reference tests, i.e. those tests that are thought to assess the same underlying cognitive ability (mean Pearson ",
      " = 0.53, range = 0.22 to 0.83, ",
      "\u2264.005). The measure of general cognitive ability based on the UK Biobank cognitive tests correlated at ",
      " 0.83 (p < .001) with a measure of general cognitive ability created using the reference tests. Four-week test-retest reliability of the UK Biobank tests were moderate-to-high (mean Pearson ",
      " = 0.55, range = 0.40 to 0.89, p\u2264.003). Despite the brief, non-standard nature of the UK Biobank cognitive tests, some tests showed substantial concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. These psychometric results provide currently-lacking information on the validity of the UK Biobank cognitive tests."

However, a limitation of bio-asphalt binders is that their high-temperature performance is not suitable for pavement construction. In recent years, nano-particles have been widely used to improve the pavement performance of asphalt binders, particularly the high-temperature performance. Thus, the nano-particles might also provide a positive modified effect on the high-temperature performance of bio-asphalt binders. Based on this, five types of nano-particles including SiO", ", CaCO", ", TiO", ", Fe", "O", ", and ZnO are selected for the preparation of modified bio-asphalt binders, using different dosages of nano-particles and bio-oil. The high- and low-temperature performances, aging resistance, workable performance, and water stability of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders and mixtures are investigated. The results reveal that, the high-temperature performance and aging resistance of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders and mixtures are improved at increased nano-particle dosages, whereas their low-temperature performance is slightly weakened.

Four temperatures between 400 and 600\u00b0C were examined as well as four residence times between ~1.0 and 10 seconds. Pyrolysis product distributions of bio-oil, char and permanent gases were determined at each reaction condition. The elemental composition of the bio-oils and chars was also assessed. The greatest bio-oil yield was recorded when working at 450\u00b0C with a volatiles residence time of 1.4 s, ~37 wt% relative to the dry ash free feedstock (excluding pyrolysis water). The amounts of char (organic fraction) and permanent gases under these conditions are ~4 wt% and 8 wt% respectively. The bio-oil yield stated above is for 'dry' bio-oil after rotary evaporation to remove solvent, which results in volatiles and pyrolysis water being removed from the bio-oil. The material removed during drying accounts for the remainder of the pyrolysis products. The 'dry' bio-oil produced under these conditions contains ~56 wt% carbon which is ~40 wt% of the carbon present in the feedstock. The oxygen content of the 450\u00b0C, 1.4 s 'dry' bio-oil is ~38 wt%, which accounts for ~33 wt% of the oxygen in the feedstock. At higher temperature or longer residence time less bio-oil and char is recovered and more gas and light volatiles are produced. Increasing the temperature has a more significant effect on product yields and composition than increasing the volatiles residence time. At 600\u00b0C and a volatiles residence time of 1.2 seconds the bio-oil yield is ~21 wt% of the daf feedstock, with a carbon content of 64 wt% of the bio-oil. The bio-oil yield from banagrass is significantly lower than from woody biomass or grasses such as switchgrass or miscanthus, but is similar to barley straw. The reason for the low bio-oil yield from banagrass is thought to be related to its high ash content (8.5 wt% dry basis) and high concentration of alkali and alkali earth metals (totaling ~2.8 wt% relative to the dry feedstock) which are catalytic and increase cracking reactions during pyrolysis."], "file_urls": ["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136511&type=printable"], "xml_urls": ["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136511&type=manuscript"], "author": ["\nTrevor James Morgan ", ",", "\nScott Q.

The activated N-WASP then activates the Arp2/3 complex which initiates ", " actin nucleation and polymerisation to form F-actin comet tails and allows bacterial cell-to-cell spreading. In a previous study, IcsA was found to have three N-WASP interacting regions (IRs): IR I (aa 185\u2013312), IR II (aa 330\u2013382) and IR III (aa 508\u2013730). The aim of this study was to more clearly define N-WASP interacting regions II and III by site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acids. Mutant IcsA proteins were expressed in both smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) and rough LPS (R-LPS) ", " strains and characterised for IcsA production level, N-WASP recruitment and F-actin comet tail formation. We have successfully identified new amino acids involved in N-WASP recruitment within different N-WASP interacting regions, and report for the first time using co-expression of mutant IcsA proteins, that N-WASP activation involves interactions with different regions on different IcsA molecules as shown by Arp3 recruitment. In addition, our findings suggest that autochaperone (AC) mutant protein production was not rescued by another AC region provided ", ", differing to that reported for two other autotransporters, PrtS and BrkA autotransporters."], "file_urls": ["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152&type=printable"], "xml_urls": ["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152&type=manuscript"], "author": ["\nMin Yan Teh,", "\nRenato Morona "], "date": "Published: February 6, 2013", "image_urls": ["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t001", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t002", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t003", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g001", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g002", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t004", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g003", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t005", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t006", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g004", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g005"], "images": [{"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t001", "path": "f75b639456a2c39ba20c168e0298bd71d4b751f0.jpg", "checksum": "cb5f1100018ef276261a50c2a46bcd10", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t002", "path": "c73766ca4a3bc66976890e998f5f02f993c69b4c.jpg", "checksum": "c695496314d4acbef4589a3e556c74a9", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t003", "path": "9570c791070de30ff9bd79a8502d5d0a146f83c1.jpg", "checksum": "b5814d5c2f951670f99f8b6408d08a57", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g001", "path": "e0af51fd6c92e281cede62ea2da88efee02f80e7.jpg", "checksum": "55a356437ee5158e85f49eafabad61e5", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g002", "path": "c2b413f9601cf5e0a5875ea695f81b72e2793527.jpg", "checksum": "37851cf8de3ee8c3c52d87836bd5729d", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t004", "path": "985ed95df0dde217ef5fbd86793e79fdb66beff4.jpg", "checksum": "f982d6d73e629f9020ca55f6409ef15b", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g003", "path": "46d8ed0883733d6517f411ba2092553631594990.jpg", "checksum": "5e2fdf9c8f6a44315c27b2c59e917299", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t005", "path": "f3d1c36255ca17135caf45ba24365bad7ace05a2.jpg", "checksum": "db3de9f5dc93bf5c6f33b3cb883ad05b", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.t006", "path": "e40e5c5cc83687d4de7074facaa9e82c36011476.jpg", "checksum": "101262055137f7e5eaf52334c871cfb6", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g004", "path": "1c575533b3f1cc0c094be9922ab0691744d516ff.jpg", "checksum": "2f7ac390541a8559745a3093d43f6443", "status": "downloaded"}, {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?download&size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055152.g005", "path": "a1f83cc172789f480271a61ebbb9c4848e043150.jpg", "checksum": "5c342a413d4e9df53ce3ee9aa21203a0", "status": "downloaded"}]}
