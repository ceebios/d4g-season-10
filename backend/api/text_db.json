Life\u2019s billion-years history of metabolic innovations led to the emergence of only two biological complexes capable of harvesting light: one based on rhodopsins and the other on (bacterio)chlorophyll. Rhodopsins encompass the most diverse and abundant photoactive proteins on Earth and were until recently canonically split between type-1 (microbial rhodopsins) and type-2 (animal rhodopsins) families. Unexpectedly, the long-lived type-1/type-2 dichotomy was recently amended through the discovery of heliorhodopsins (HeRs) (Pushkarev et al. 2018), a novel and exotic family of rhodopsins (i.e. type-3) that evaded recognition in our current homology-driven scrutiny of life\u2019s genomic milieu. Here, we bring to resolution the debated monoderm/diderm occurrence patterns by conclusively showing that HeR distribution is restricted to monoderms. Furthermore, through investigating protein domain fusions, contextual genomic information, and gene co-expression data we show that HeRs likely function as generalised light-dependent switches involved in the mitigation of light-induced oxidative stress and metabolic circuitry regulation. We reason that HeR\u2019s ability to function as sensory rhodopsins is corroborated by their photocycle dynamics (Pushkarev et al. 2018) and that their presence and function in monoderms is likely connected to the increased sensitivity to light-induced damage of these organisms (Maclean et al. 2009).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "d0ae6c90-ac72-4a77-8bb2-908b33bd3e46": {"text": "Type-1 and \u22122 rhodopsins families share a similar topological conformation and little or no sequence similarity among each other. Despite dissimilarities in function, structure and phylogeny, type-1 and \u22122 rhodopsins have a similar membrane orientation with their N-terminus being situated in the extracellular space. Identified during a functional metagenomics screen and characterised by low sequence similarity when compared to type-1 rhodopsins, HeRs attracted increasing research interest due to their peculiar membrane orientation (i.e. N-terminus in the cytoplasm and the C-terminus in the extracellular space)(Pushkarev et al. 2018), unusual protein structure (Kovalev et al. 2020) and controversial taxonomic distribution (Flores-Uribe, Hevroni, and Ghai 2019). While electrophysiological (Pushkarev et al. 2018), physicochemical (Tanaka et al. 2020) and structural (Shihoya et al. 2019; Kovalev et al. 2020) studies achieved great progress in elucidating a series of characteristics ranging from photocycle length (indicating no pumping activity) to detailed protein organization, they provide no data regarding the biological function of HeRs. Moreover, polarized opinions regarding the putative ecological role and taxonomic distribution of HeR-encoding organisms (Flores-Uribe, Hevroni, and Ghai 2019; Kovalev et al. 2020) call for the use of novel approaches in establishing HeR functionality. This work draws its essence from the tenet that functionally linked genes within prokaryotes are co-regulated, and thus occur close to each other (Aravind 2000; Huynen et al. 2000). Within this framework, the functions of uncharacterised genes (i.e. HeRs) can be inferred from their genomic surroundings. Here we couple HeR\u2019s distributional patterns with contextual genomic information involving protein domain fusions and operon organization, and gene expression data to shed light on HeRs functionality.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "b5d2722e-c3b9-4fcb-8742-882143926431": {"text": "Previous assessments of taxonomic distribution of HeRs reported conflicting data regarding their presence in monoderm (Flores-Uribe, Hevroni, and Ghai 2019) and diderm (Kovalev et al. 2020) prokaryotes. In order to accurately map HeR taxonomic distribution we used the GTDB database (release 89), since it contains a wide-range of high-quality genomes derived from isolated strains and environmental metagenome-assembled genomes, classified within a robust phylogenomic framework (Parks et al. 2020). By scanning 24,706 genomes, we identified 450 bona fide HeR sequences (topology: C-terminal inside and N-terminal outside, seven transmembrane helices and a SxxxK motif in helix 7; Supplementary Table S1) spanned across 17 phyla (out of 151; Supplementary Table S2). In order to assign HeR-containing genomes to either monoderm or diderm categories, we employed a set of 27 manually curated protein domain markers that are expected to be restricted to organisms possessing double-membrane cellular envelopes (i.e. diderms) (Taib et al. 2020). While most analyses were expected to be influenced by varying levels of genome completeness, we found that a conservative criterion of presence of at least ten marker domains singled out all diderm lineages (i.e. Negativicutes, Halanaerobiales and Limnochondria) (Taib et al. 2020; Megrian et al. 2020) within the larger monoderm phylum Firmicutes, apart from correctly identifying other well-known diderms. Except for three genomes (one each belonging to Myxococcota, Spirochaetota and Dictyoglomota phyla), all other HeR occurrences were restricted to monoderms (Supplementary Table S2). Examination of the HeR-encoding Myxoccoccota contig by querying its predicted proteins against the RefSeq and GTDB databases revealed it to be an actinobacterial contaminant. The Spirochaeta genome was incomplete (60% estimated completeness) and only encoded for two outer membrane marker genes, making any inferences regarding its affiliation to monoderm or diderm bacteria impossible. However, we could not rule out that this genome could belong to a member lacking lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Taib et al. 2020). The Dictyoglomota genome belongs to an isolate, and despite its high completeness, it encodes only five markers. Combined with the notion that Dictyoglomota are known to have atypical membrane architectures (Saiki et al. 1985), the presence of only five markers points towards the absence of a classical diderm cell envelope. Apart from these exceptions, all other HeR-encoding genomes are monoderm and, at least within this collection, we find no strong evidence of HeRs being present in any organism that is conclusively diderm. We also identified HeRs in several assembled metagenomes and metatranscriptomes (see Methods). For improved resolution of taxonomic origin, we considered only contigs of at least 5 Kb in length (n = 1,340 from metagenomes and n = 4 from metatranscriptomes). Following a strict approach to taxonomy assignment (i.e. at least 60 % genes giving best-hits to the same phylum and not just majority-rule), we could designate a phylum for most HeRs. Without any exception, we found that all the contigs that received robust taxonomic classification (n = 1,319) belonged to known monoderm phyla (Supplementary Table S3).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "02ce7ff8-f385-4f3b-9bf5-6f20196e5894": {"text": "Domain fusions with rhodopsins are recently providing novel insights into the diverse functional couplings that enhance the utility of a light sensor, e.g. the case of a phosphodiesterase domain fused with a type-1 rhodopsin (Ikuta et al. 2020). As far as we are aware, no domain fusions have been described for HeRs yet. In our search for such domain fusions that may shed light on HeR functionality, the MORN repeat (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus, PF02493) was found in multiple copies (typically 3) at the cytoplasmic N-terminus of some HeRs (n = 36). A tentative 3D model for a representative MORN-HeR could be generated and is shown in Figure 1A. These MORN-HeR sequences were phylogenetically restricted to two environmental branches of MAGs recovered from haloalkaline sediments that affiliate to the family Syntrophomonadaceae (phylum Firmicutes) (Timmers et al. 2018; Vavourakis et al. 2018, 2019) (Supplementary Figure 1). The prototypic MORN repeat, consisting of 14 amino acids with the consensus sequence YEGEWxNGKxHGYG, was first described in 2000 (Takeshima et al. 2000) from junctophilins present in skeletal muscle and later recognized to be ubiquitous in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (El-Gebali et al. 2019). This conserved signature can be seen in the alignment of MORN-repeats fused to HeRs (Supplementary Figure 2). MORN-repeats have been shown to bind to phospholipids (Im et al. 2007; Ma et al. 2006), promoting stable interactions with plasma membranes (Takeshima et al. 2000) and also function as protein-protein interaction modules involved in di- and oligomerization (Sajko et al. 2020). They are expected to be intracellular and provide a large putative interaction surface (either with other MORN-HeRs or other proteins). A widespread adaptation of bacteria to alkaline environmental conditions is the increased fluidity of their plasma membranes achieved by the incorporation of branched-chain and unsaturated fatty acids which ultimately influences the configuration and activity of membrane integral proteins such as ATP synthases and various transporters (Kanno et al. 2015). Microbial rhodopsins typically associate as oligomers in vivo, which is also the case with heliorhodopsins that are known to form dimers (Shibata et al. 2018; Shihoya et al. 2019). The presence of MORN-repeats in HeRs exclusively within extreme haloalkaliphilic bacteria (class Dethiobacteria) may be accounted for via their potential role in stabilizing HeR dimers in conditions of increased membrane fluidity (Supplementary Figure 4). Another possibility would be the interaction of MORN-repeats with other MORN-repeat containing proteins encoded in these MAGs. We could indeed identify multiple MORN-protein domain fusions co-occurring in genomes of analysed Dethiobacteria (Supplementary Figures 1 and 3; Supplementary Table S15). Even though the nature of interactions amongst these proteins with intracellular MORN-repeats is unclear, they raise the possibility that MORN-repeats act as downstream transducers of conformational changes occuring in HeRs. Such tandem repeat structures may function as versatile target recognition sites capable of binding not only small molecules like nucleotides but also peptides and larger proteins (Kajava 2012). If true, this would render HeRs as sensory rhodopsins. In support of this, we found several genes in close proximity to MORN-HeRs encoding signature protein domains (e.g. PAS, HisKA, HATPase_c) that are known to be involved in histidine kinase signalling (Aravind, Iyer, and Anantharaman 2010) (Figure 2A).", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "c5f30b75-b0e2-432d-bc04-e46cc2853416": {"text": "Phylogenomic tree of MORN-Heliorhodopsin (MORN-HeR) encoding MAGs.

We found at least ten N-terminal extensions of HeRs (ntv1-ntv10), 22 variants of ECL1 (extracellular loop 1), a single type of loop extension for ICL2 (intracellular loop 2) and three variants of ICL3 (intracellular loop 3). A complete listing of all alignments and summary results of HHpred can be found in Supplementary Table S8. Remarkably, we found significant matches in a set of six sequences (all originating from Thermoplasmatales archaea) to zinc ribbon proteins (Pfam domain zinc_ribbon_4) at the N-terminus of some heliorhodopsins (these extensions are termed N-terminal variant 1 or ntv1, Supplementary Table S8). Zinc ribbons belong to the larger family of Zinc-finger domains (Krishna et al., 2003). A CxxC-17x-CxxC was found in this region that likely coordinates a metal (e.g., zinc or iron). These CxxC_CxC type motifs are common to a wider family of Zinc finger-like proteins that were initially found to bind to DNA and later shown to be capable of binding to RNAs, proteins and small molecules (Krishna, Majumdar, and Grishin 2003). Similar motifs are also seen in Rubredoxins and Cys_rich_KTR domains. We term these fused ntv1 protein variants as Znf-HeRs (Zinc finger Heliorhodopins). A modelled structure for a representative Znf-HeR is shown in Figure 1. In one contig encoding a Znf-HeR we identified a histidine kinase that could be functionally linked (Figure 2B). Notably, most identified Znf-HeRs are flanked by genes known to be triggered by light exposure and play key roles in photoprotection (i.e. carotenoid biosynthesis genes Lycopene cyclase, phytoene desaturase \u2013 Amino-oxidase, squalene/phytoene synthase \u2013 SQS-PSY) and UV-induced DNA damage repair (DNA photolyases, UV-DNA damage endonucleases \u2013 UvdE) (Rastogi et al. 2010; Yatsunami et al. 2014). Recent research showed that HeRs from Thermoplasmatales archaea (7aHeR) and uncultured freshwater Actinobacteria (48C12) (for which the structure is resolved and lacks the ntv1 extension) might bind zinc (Hashimoto et al. 2020). As the zinc binding site could not be precisely identified it was suggested that it could be located in the cytoplasmic part, and responsible for modifying the function of HeR. Our discovery of Znf-HeRs offers additional, more direct indications of the role of zinc in the possible downstream signalling by HeRs.", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "a22d6bbd-4d35-423b-9c0e-94a45d63c3f7": {"text": "Given the large number of long contigs encoding HeRs (from genomes and metagenomes), we sought to identify candidate genes that could be transcribed together with HeRs (in the same operon). We used the following strict criteria for obtaining such genes 1) the intergenic distance between such a gene and the HeR must be less than 10 bp, and 2) the gene must be located on the same strand. A number of interesting candidates emerged in this analysis with the most frequent ones being summarized in Figure 3 (a complete table can be found in Supplementary Table S9). We identified multiple instances in which genes with Glutaredoxin and GSHPx PFAM domains were found adjacent to HeRs (n = 31). Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins with active disulphide bonds that utilize reduced glutathione as an electron donor to catalyze thiol-disulphide exchange reactions. They are involved in a wide variety of critical cellular processes like the maintenance of cellular redox state, iron and redox-sensing, and biosynthesis of iron-sulphur clusters (Lillig, Berndt, and Holmgren 2008; Rouhier et al. 2010). Glutathione is also used by glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) to reduce hydrogen peroxide and peroxide radicals i.e. as an anti-oxidative stress protection system (Bhabak and Mugesh 2010). Additionally, there are also instances where Glutaredoxin and genes containing Glyoxalase_2 domains may be co-transcribed with HeRs. Glyoxalases, in concert with glutaredoxins, are critical for detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxic byproduct of glycolysis (Ferguson et al. 1998). Moreover, adjacent to HeRs we find at least three instances where a catalase gene is also present (in Actinobacteria; see Supplementary Figures S10\u2013S11). Collectively, these observations suggest a role for HeRs in oxidative stress mitigation. In one case, we found a gene encoding the DICT domain (Figure 3) which is frequently associated to GGDEF, EAL, HD-GYP, STAS, and two-component system histidine kinases.

In order to gather more definitive evidence for co-transcription we performed strand-specific metatranscriptome sequencing for a freshwater sample (see Methods). We recovered six HeR-encoding transcripts that were > 1 kb in length. All these transcripts are predicted to originate from highly abundant freshwater Actinobacteria with streamlined genomes (four transcripts from \u201cCa. Planktophila\u201d and two from \u201cCa. Nanopelagicus\u201d) (Supplementary Table S12) (Neuenschwander et al. 2018). Overall, there are three types of transcripts based upon gene content: class1 \u2013 encoding Glutamine synthetase catalytic subunit and NAD+ synthetase; class2 \u2013 encoding a hydrolase, a peptidase and a DUF393 domain containing protein, and class3 \u2013 encoding glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase (GSDH) (Figure 4B and Supplementary Table S12). A common theme for glutamine synthetase and NAD+ synthetase is that both utilize ammonia and ATP to produce glutamine and NAD+ respectively. Moreover, some NAD+ synthetases may be glutamine dependent (Resto, Yaffe, and Gerratana 2009). Glutamine synthetase in particular is a key enzyme for nitrogen metabolism in prokaryotes at large (Garc\u00eda-Dom\u00ednguez, Reyes, and Florencio 1999). For hydrolases and peptidases, the function prediction is somewhat broad. Glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase catalyses the production of gluconolactone from glucose (Oubrie et al. 1999). Therefore, it appears that all six HeRs are generally co-transcribed with genes involved in nitrogen assimilation and degradation/assimilation of sugars and peptides. This would suggest that these processes are also influenced by light, with such a link between light-dependent increase in sugar uptake and metabolic activity being recently proposed in non-phototrophic Actinobacteria (Maresca et al. 2019). Light also triggers photosynthetic activity, increasing availability of sugars and other nutrients (e.g. glutamine and ammonia) for heterotrophs.

Furthermore, multiple types of N-terminal domain fusions found in specific subfamilies of HeRs (i.e. MORN domains in haloalkaliphilic Firmicutes and Zinc ribbon type domains in Thermoplasmatales archaea) point to possible downstream signalling which may be effected by recruitment of additional, as yet unknown, partner proteins.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "0aeed2b3-7297-403b-9c16-7f3ef20e7b14": {"text": "We further propose a critical role for HeRs in protecting monoderm cells from light-induced oxidative damage. In this sense, we observed a close association and probable transcriptional linkage of HeRs to glyoxylases and glutaredoxins (sometimes seen as overlapping genes). Given that light can induce the uptake and metabolism of sugars, as previously discussed for certain Actinobacteria (Maresca et al. 2019), it is expected that increased sugar availability resulting from photosynthesis leads to increased glycolytic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. Glycolysis also produces small amounts of toxic methylglyoxal that can be neutralized by the combined action of glyoxylases and glutaredoxins. In this sense, it appears that at least in some Actinobacteria, glyoxylases and glutaredoxins may be transcribed together with HeRs, but how the transcription is controlled remains unclear. Additional evidence of transcriptional linkages of HeRs to proteins like peroxiredoxin and catalase also imply a light-dependent activation, boosting the cellular response to light induced oxidative damage which may be critical for both aerobes and anaerobes. Evidence from strand-specific HeR transcripts originating from freshwater Actinobacteria suggests the further involvement of HeRs in nitrogen and sugar metabolism via glutamate synthase, NAD+ synthases and glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenases in these organisms.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "6293f736-3315-48e5-8c33-8a41cbc1a60e": {"text": "Overall, the picture that emerges (at least for some organisms) is one of HeR\u2019s role in responding to light and transmitting the signal via histidine kinases.

The very restricted distribution of HeRs to monoderms would support this view as well. Even so, HeRs are not universally present in monoderms and when present, appear to be associated with diverse genes involved in signal transduction, oxidative stress mitigation, nitrogen and glucose metabolism. This would suggest they have been exapted as generalized sensory switches that may allow light-dependent control of metabolic activity in multiple lineages, somewhat similar to type-1 rhodopsins where minor modifications have led to emergence of a wide variety of ion-pumps (Kandori 2020). The frequent distribution of HeRs in aquatic environments (habitats characterised by increased light penetration), where they commonly occur within phylum Actinobacteriota, helps us to explain their monoderm-restricted presence. Abundant freshwater actinobacterial lineages are generally typified by lower GC content (Ghai, McMahon, and Rodriguez-Valera 2012) and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress damage (Kim et al. 2019). This susceptibility is also illustrated by actinobacterial phages that exhibit positive selection towards reactive oxygen species defense mechanisms (Kavagutti et al. 2019). Given the fact that monoderms are generally more sensitive to light-induced damage and corroborated with up-mentioned metabolic implications, we consider that HeRs evolved as sensory switches capable of triggering a fast response against photo-oxidative stress in prokaryotic lineages more sensitive to light.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "ca6efbdf-4240-4239-afae-d9fe8091d1f6": {"text": "We used previously published metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data from freshwaters (Andrei et al. 2019; Kavagutti et al. 2019; Mehrshad et al. 2018), haloalkaline brine and sediment (Vavourakis et al. 2018, 2019), brackish sediments (Bulzu et al. 2019), GEOTRACES cruise (Biller et al. 2018) and TARA expeditions (Salazar et al. 2019).

The overwintering species maintain green leaves (or needles) over the winter. To meet the needs of agriculture and landscaping, many overwintering evergreen and biennial species, including trees and crops, were introduced to higher latitudes. The introduction of overwintering species to higher latitudes is more difficult than deciduous species due to the environmental challenges that green leaves of introduced overwintering species has to withstand harsher winter conditions compared to their native region of origin. The survival and avoiding serious injuries of evergreen leaves during winter is critical for the success of introduced species to higher latitudes. In winter, the green leaves of overwintering species have to withstand and cope not only the dehydration and frost damage but also the possible photodamage of photosynthetic apparatus caused by excess light absorption by the chlorophylls in evergreen leaves (\u00d6quist and Huner, 2003). The low temperatures in winter imposes thermodynamic restrictions and slows down the activities of Calvin cycle related enzymes, so not 100% of the light absorbed by the light harvesting complexes (LHC) can be utilized for CO2 fixation. The imbalance between the capacity for harvesting light energy and the capacity to dissipate this energy through metabolic activity such as CO2 assimilation, can potentially result in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to photoinhibition and photooxidative damage of photosystem II (PSII) (Aro ; Takahashi and Badger, 2011).

The photoprotective pigment melanin is synthesized within melanocytes and packaged inside specialized membrane-bound lysosome-related organelles (LROs), termed melanosomes (Marks and Seabra, 2001; Raposo and Marks, 2002; Hearing, 2005). Melanocytes reside in the basal layer of the epidermis sparsely spread at an approximately 1:40 ratio among keratinocytes, forming epidermal-melanin units (Fitzpatrick and Breathnach, 1963; Bino ). Fully melanized melanosomes are transported from the perinuclear region of melanocytes to the dendrites and then transferred to keratinocytes, where melanin granules form a supra-nuclear cap that absorbs and scatters UVr, protecting nuclear DNA from damage (Scott, 2003; Park ). Thus, melanin biogenesis and transfer must be tightly regulated to sustain skin pigmentation and ensure efficient photoprotection. Indeed, exposure to UVr enhances secretion of soluble factors by keratinocytes, such as endothelin-1 and \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), which in turn increase melanin synthesis in melanocytes (Yamaguchi and Hearing, 2010; Taisuke and Hearing, 2011; Hirobe, 2014). \u03b1-MSH binds to Melanocortin-1 receptor on the surface of melanocytes, stimulating melanogenesis and subsequently increasing melanin transfer to keratinocytes (Mosca et al., 2020).

The co-fractionation of SNAREs and Rab3a from mature melanosomes strongly suggests a role for this protein in melanin exocytosis. Rab3a was also described to regulate the trans-SNARE complex assembly, which promotes vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (Hong, 2005). Indeed, Rab3a is involved in several vesicular secretory processes, such as neurotransmitter release in neurons, hormone release in endocrine cells and insulin secretion in pancreatic \u03b2-cells (Fukuda, 2008). Moreover, Rab3 regulates the exocytosis of conventional lysosomes and several LROs, including large dense-core neuroendocrine vesicles, dense core granules and Weibel-Palade bodies (Raposo, G. ; Fukuda, 2008; Quevedo ; Delevoye ). For instance, a Rab3a-dependent complex was described to control lysosome exocytosis during plasma membrane repair (Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o ) and Rab3a is essential for dense core granule exocytosis from sperm cells after Rab27a-mediated transport (Quevedo ).

We started by evaluating if the culture medium that remains in the isolated pellet of exocytosed melanin affects the measurements. Therefore, considering that the remaining culture medium is diluted 1:8 after the solubilization of the melanin pellet, we assessed the emission spectra at the excitation wavelength of 470 nm. We analyzed different diluted culture media - RPMI, DMEM and KCM (DMEM medium consumed by confluent XB2 keratinocytes in culture for 3 days) - and used NaOH as the blank. All the media showed similar fluorescence intensity along the emission spectra (Figure S1A). Thus, we can confidently state that the culture medium does not interfere with the quantification of exocytosed melanin. Additionally, we observed that synthetic melanin, diluted culture media and the blank show a common emission peak at 550 nm (Figure S1A).

This enhanced intracellular melanin levels in melanocytes cultured with DMEM was also reported by others (Skoniecka ). Furthermore, we detected a 4-fold increase in melanin exocytosis, when compared with melanocytes cultured with RPMI (Figures 1A and 1B). When melanocytes are cultured in KCM, the levels of exocytosed melanin double (Figures 1A and 1C) and the amount of intracellular melanin decreases by about 50%, compared to melanocytes cultured in DMEM (Figures 1B and 1D). Next, we tested if conditioned medium from melanocyte/keratinocyte co-cultures (MKCM) can stimulate melanin exocytosis in a similar manner to KCM. Surprisingly, we observed that melanocytes cultured with KCM exocytose double the melanin than melanocytes cultured with MKCM (Figure 1C). However, intracellular melanin levels are similar in both cases (Figure 1D).

Previously, we implicated Rab11b in melanin exocytosis from melanocytes cultured with RPMI (Tarafder ; Moreiras ). Additionally, Rab3a was suggested to play a role in melanin exocytosis (Araki ; Scott and Zhao, 2001). Therefore, we analyzed the role of Rab3a and Rab11b in KCM-stimulated melanin exocytosis. For this, we efficiently silenced Rab11b or Rab3a in melanocytes cultured with RPMI, DMEM or KCM (\u226560% silencing, Figures S2A and S2B). We also used melanocytes transfected with a non-targeting siRNA (siControl) as the negative control. We found that upon Rab3a depletion, melanin exocytosis is impaired by 50% in melanocytes cultured in KCM, but not in DMEM or RPMI (Figure 2A). In contrast, Rab11b silencing does not affect KCM-induced melanin exocytosis (Figure 2A). Instead, Rab11b silencing significantly reduces melanin exocytosis from melanocytes cultured in RPMI (Figure 2A), confirming our previous reports (Tarafder ; Moreiras ). To rule out that the differences observed are due to defects in melanin synthesis, which in turn can impair the amount of exocytosed melanin, we also analyzed the amount of intracellular melanin. We confirmed that the defects in melanin exocytosis cannot be explained by defects in melanin synthesis, since no decrease in intracellular melanin was found in any of the conditions tested (Figure 2B). Instead, we observed a small but significant increase in intracellular melanin levels upon Rab3a depletion in melanocytes cultured with KCM, which could be a consequence of the impairment in melanin exocytosis (Figure 2B). To exclude off-target effects of the siRNA pool used to silence Rab3a, we performed a rescue experiment. For this, we plated wild-type or lentivirus-transduced Melan-ink4a melanocytes overexpressing GFP or GFP-Rab3a and then silenced these cells for Rab3a. Importantly, Rab3a expression levels were assessed by western blot to confirm the silencing and overexpression levels for all the conditions tested (Figures S3A and S3B). We found that by overexpressing human GFP-Rab3a in Rab3a-silenced melanocytes, the amount of exocytosed melanin is restored to the levels observed in siControl melanocytes (Figure 2C). In addition, GFP-Rab3a but not GFP overexpression rescues the augmented intracellular melanin levels caused by Rab3a depletion (Figure 2D). Noteworthy, we found that KCM-stimulated melanocytes overexpressing GFP-Rab3a show double the amount of exocytosed melanin than melanocytes overexpressing GFP (Figure 2E), while no significant differences in intracellular melanin between the two conditions were observed (Figure 2F). This reinforces the conclusion that Rab3a acts as a regulator of KCM-stimulated melanin exocytosis. Altogether, these results suggest the existence of two distinct melanin exocytosis pathways: one regulated by Rab11b and another induced by KCM and regulated by Rab3a.", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "d25dbd62-ec1c-4ecb-ba8f-76b9bc6e2577": {"text": "(A) Exocytosed and (B) intracellular melanin levels of melanocytes cultured with RPMI, DMEM or keratinocyte-conditioned medium (KCM) and silenced for Rab3a (siRab3a), Rab11b (siRab11b) or transfected with a non-targeting siRNA (siControl).

To study this, we overexpressed GFP-Rab3a or GFP as a negative control, in Melan-ink4a melanocytes. The transfected cells were cultured with KCM or DMEM for 24 hours and melanosomes labelled with HMB45 antibody, which recognizes PMEL, a scaffold protein onto which melanin is deposited. Firstly, we confirmed the accumulation of GFP-Rab3a in the Golgi previously described (Zerial and McBride, 2001; Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o ) through co-localization with the coat protein COPI (Figure S4). Then, we evaluated the subcellular localization of melanosomes in melanocytes cultured with DMEM or KCM. In KCM-stimulated melanocytes, 63% of melanosomes are recruited to dendrites and only 37% remain in the cell body (Figures 3A, 3C and 3D), while melanocytes cultured with DMEM show 45% of melanosomes in dendrites and 55% in the cell body (Figures 3B, 3C and 3D). Therefore, the percentage of melanosomes in dendrites increases by about 20% in the presence of KCM, comparing with melanocytes incubated with DMEM (Figures 3C, 4A and 4B). Moreover, KCM increases by about 10% the number of melanosomes positioned close to plasma membrane of dendrites, when compared to DMEM-incubated melanocytes (Figures 4A, 4B, 4D and 4E). Upon overexpression of GFP-Rab3a in KCM-stimulated melanocytes, GFP-Rab3a co-localizes with about 35% of melanosomes in melanocyte dendrites, while only 15% of co-localization is observed in KCM-stimulated melanocytes overexpressing GFP (Figures 4A and 4C). Noteworthy, under KCM stimulation, most GFP-Rab3a co-localizes with melanosomes close to plasma membrane (Figure 4A). These effects appear to be KCM-induced as only about 10% of the melanosomes in the dendrites co-localize with either GFP-Rab3a or GFP in DMEM-incubated melanocytes (Figures 4B and 4C).

However, their effects on melanin exocytosis or transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes have not been studied (Yamaguchi and Hearing, 2010; Taisuke and Hearing, 2011; Hirobe, 2014). To clarify this unsolved question, we started by assessing the effect on melanin exocytosis of three different culture media: RPMI (Melan-ink4a melanocyte growth medium), DMEM (XB2 keratinocyte growth medium) and KCM (DMEM medium consumed by confluent XB2 keratinocytes in culture for 3 days). We found that soluble factors present in KCM specifically stimulate melanin exocytosis, in addition to stimulating melanogenesis, while DMEM was particularly effective in stimulating melanogenesis and less effective in stimulating melanin exocytosis (Figures 1A and 1B). To explain the effects on melanogenesis, we note that DMEM has 3.5 times more L-tyrosine than RPMI and that L-tyrosine is the initial substrate of tyrosinase, the key melanogenic enzyme (Yamaguchi and Hearing, 2010; Taisuke and Hearing, 2011; Hirobe, 2014). Interestingly, melanocytes cultured with KCM show half of intracellular melanin levels than DMEM (Figures 1B), which can be explained by the increase in melanin exocytosis and/or the consumption of the L-tyrosine in DMEM due to the culture of keratinocytes for 3 days in this medium to prepare KCM.

Our studies suggest that Rab3a specifically regulates KCM-induced melanin exocytosis from melanocytes, but not from melanocytes cultured with DMEM or RPMI (Figures 2A, 2B and 6). Intriguingly, the molecular regulators of melanin exocytosis from melanocytes cultured with DMEM remain to be identified as neither Rab11b nor Rab3a show any role in this case.

In co-cultures, keratinocytes internalize and store melanocores in specialized organelles, which we proposed to name as melanokerasomes. Alternatively, melanin exocytosis is triggered by KCM (right).

However, no significant changes in intracellular melanin levels were observed between these conditions (Figure 1D), reinforcing the specificity of KCM stimulation on melanin exocytosis. Importantly, the crosstalk between melanocytes and keratinocytes in co-cultures can affect the amount or identity of soluble factors secreted by keratinocytes. Indeed, keratinocytes alone and keratinocytes co-cultured with melanocytes show a different secretome. For instance, it was reported that keratinocytes in co-culture release exosomes carrying miRNAs, which in turn stimulate melanogenesis in melanocytes, something that was not observed in keratinocytes cultured alone (Lo Cicero ). Additionally, co-cultures could allow for cross-talk mediated by cell-to-cell transient contacts. Therefore, the present experiments highlight the importance of melanocyte-keratinocyte communication in the regulation of pigmentation through melanin synthesis, transport and transfer. Moreover, our observations suggest that the concentrations of keratinocyte-derived factors or even the factors themselves are distinct between KCM and MKCM, which can explain the differences in the regulation of melanin exocytosis and exocytosed melanin levels found in each of these conditions (Figure 6). Therefore, it is possible that keratinocytes downregulate the release of soluble factors upon internalizing melanin secreted by melanocytes in co-cultures. In this case, keratinocytes cultured alone would keep secreting factors to stimulate melanin synthesis and exocytosis in a positive feedback loop, resulting in a higher concentration of factors in the medium.

It is a nitrogen (N) limited hard-water lake, whose trophic state has recently transitioned from oligotrophic to mesotrophic [3]. The littoral zone covers about 4% of the lake area and is now dominated by the introduced Hydrilla veriticillata (Hydrocharitaceae), a plant native to the warm regions of Asia. This submersed macrophyte is one of the most successful aquatic invaders with a wide ecological amplitude, fast growth rates, and high dispersion ability. Hydrilla therefore has a great potential to invade a variety of habitats, often resulting in important physical, chemical, and biotic effects on the freshwater environments worldwide [4,5]. These changes are not always considered solely negative, however, and the ecological services Hydrilla provides need to be considered [6] Hydrilla possesses some remarkable ecophysiological traits: it can grow at depths exceeding 10 m, near the water surface it branches profusely to form a dense canopy intercepting light to the exclusion of other submersed plants [7], it is photosynthetically highly efficient, may utilize bicarbonate as a carbon source if the lake pH and carbonate concentrations are high, and, during the night, it can also switch to C4-like carbon metabolism [8]. The dense foliage breaking the water surface often supports vigorous growth of green filamentous algae such as Cladophora spp. [2]. The presence of Hydrilla in the lake was first detected in 2002 and it has since substantially changed the littoral biogeochemistry, such as water column dissolved oxygen profiles and macroinvertebrate diversity [2]. Despite the low N availability, the highly productive Hydrilla populations at Atitl\u00e1n were shown to have lower C:N:P ratios than native species, contributing to faster decomposition and overall fast biomass turnover rates [2]. The questions which intrigued us were: How does Hydrilla sustain such fast growth under low N availability?

Do they differ in composition and function to those found on the Hydrilla companion, Cladophora?", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "ae18b125-33e3-4e91-a99f-4d7ead87592e": {"text": "An important ecophysiological aspect in some macrophytes, observed more frequently in submerged species with small root:shoot ratios and simple anatomy, including Hydrilla, is the reduced role of the rhizosphere [9,10].

It is now becoming widely recognized that plant-associated microorganisms, both endophytic and epiphytic, can become important functional drivers of their eukaryotic hosts [12]. Aquatic macrophytes, as well as macroscopic filamentous algae, often host unique assemblages of microbiota on their surfaces and within their tissues, which differ significantly from those found in the plankton [11,13]. These complex microbial communities likely influence many functions of their host and contribute to the nutrient cycling and energy flow in aquatic ecosystem [14,15]. Examples of potential microbial activities include N2 fixation, nitrification and denitrification, Fe (III) reduction; Fe (II) oxidation, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, methanotrophy, and many others. Nitrogen fixation has previously been found associated with several macrophyte species [16\u201318] as well as seagrasses [19,20]. Epiphytic microbiota have also been investigated on large filamentous algae such as Cladophora spp. and shown to display potential for biogeochemical cycling and traits that foster host growth [21\u201323].

Because of this large potential, further confirmed by the high biomass turn-over rates in Hydrilla stands measured by Rejm\u00e1nkov\u00e1 et al. 2018b, it is possible that Hydrilla and Cladophora microbiomes are involved in some form of \u201eN mining\u201d.

Considering the continuously rising trophy levels in lake Atitl\u00e1n and the fact that the \u201eN mining\u201d process is consistently suppressed by high N supply or substrate N concentrations [62], assessing the accompanying changes in the functional composition of the microbiomes and the associated alterations in the algae-plat-microbe interactions merits further study.", "figure_ref": ["fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "a37437d2-b6d4-4ea9-be06-83cd644f36a5": {"text": "The presence of several typically ectomycorrhizal fungal genera associated with both Cladophora filaments and Hydrilla leaves was surprising to us and we considered the possibility of sample contamination by spores being wind-blown onto the lake water surface from the shore.

While the results of some studies of the macrophyte beds show positive net N fluxes due to efficient N2-fixation [65], other studies on peri/epiphytic communities report net N loss by denitrification [66]. The outcome of the N2-fixation (source)/denitrification (sink) coupling is clearly dependent on many factors, including nitrate availability in the system, dissolved organic carbon availability, season, or dissolved oxygen. As we have only measured N2-fixation activity, we cannot say anything about the net flux of N in the Atitl\u00e1n littoral communities, although significant rates of epiphytic denitrification are frequently found associated with submersed vegetation despite the high oxygen concentrations in the surrounding water [67]. However, the importance of perifytic denitrification is only likely to increase with increasing lake trophy and, therefore, given the current eutrophication rates in the lake watershed, the stands of the invasive Hydrilla hosting denitrifying microorganisms may play an increasingly important role in removing excess N from the watercolumn of the littoral zones in the near future.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "62a141a0-12a7-43a9-943b-54d013fa844a": {"text": "Based on the results of this study, as well as previously published data, we attemted to estimate the contribution of N2-fixation associated with Hydrilla phyllosphere microbiomes to covering the N metabolic needs of the host plant. Based on lake Atitl\u00e1n bathymetry [26], the area of the littoral zones capable of supporting Hydrilla growth is 4,86 km2. We estimate that approximately half of that area is covered by Hydrilla stands. According to published results [2], the average biomass of Hydrilla leaves that are exposed to photosynthetically active radiation is 600 g m\u22122, which represents 1. 458. 000 kg of leaf DW in the littoral zone. According to our average measured N2-fixation rates (assuming that 3 mol of C2H4 produced represent 1 mol of N2 reduced, and that there are 200 days per year suitable for N2-fixation), the process can supply 2.2 g N kg\u22121 DW day-1 into the system, which represents 3.2 tons of N littoral\u22121 year\u22121. Hydrilla biomass contains approximately 2% of N [2]. Because of the missing seasonality, the Hydrilla whole-shoot biomass (leaves and stems) in the lake littoral can be estimated at 3000 tones throughout the year. If we assume a biomass turnover time of 4 months [2] and 40% N reutilisation efficiency (as estimated for submersed, fast growing macrophytes by Adamec 2014), then the Hydrilla stands contain approximately 110 tons of N, of which at least 3% can be supplied by microbial N2-fixation alone (likely a conservative estimate). However, the presence of efficient microbial decomposers, the very fast rates under which the senescent biomas is turned over [2], and the fact that Hydrilla stands represent barriers which effectively retard water flow and exchange [11,69] are likely responsible for the elevated nutrient levels observed in littoral watercolumn compared to the pelagial (Table 1).

Coral fitness and thus reef-building is largely dependent on the interactions of the cnidarian animal host and its endosymbiotic microalgae belonging to the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium. An additional feature of corals is their close interaction with associated microbes that form a diverse microbiome (Bourne et al., 2009). While microbes and nighttime feeding on particles and zooplankton provide essential nutrients and some organic carbon, the coral mainly relies on the supply of labile carbon from Symbiodinium photosynthesis (Muscatine et al., 1981). By regulating the nutrient supply to the microalgae and ensuring sufficient light and inorganic carbon supply, the coral host keeps its photosymbionts in a state of unbalanced growth stimulating net O2 production and the excretion of photosynthates in the form of simple carbohydrates from Symbiodinium to the host (Falkowski et al., 1984). It is estimated that Symbiodinium photosynthesis can cover up to >90% of the energy demand of the coral host (Muscatine et al., 1981). Optimization of Symbiodinium light exposure for photosynthesis and photoprotection against high UV and solar radiation is thus a key trait in corals, and several strategies for such optimization have been identified in corals (summarised in Wangpraseurt, 2016).

The main findings of the present study show that coral tissue scattering was ~87% stronger than skeletal scattering for a wide range of investigated corals (Table 2). These results confirm earlier observations of high tissue scattering and low skeletal scattering (Wangpraseurt et al., 2016). It is important to point out what low skeletal scattering implies for coral light transport as different interpretations of the significance of scattering in corals have been promoted (Enr\u00edquez et al., 2017; Marcelino et al., 2013; Wangpraseurt et al., 2016).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tbl2"]}, "10935028-9e93-441c-9201-ea4c0e2aeff8": {"text": "Average of coral tissue and skeleton optical parameters", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "0b909fd0-c3a5-4e2a-90b1-13ba52404760": {"text": "Marcelino et al. (2013) characterized the reduced scattering coefficient of coral skeletons and showed that corals with low \u03bcs\u2019 are characterized by a higher spread of light within the skeleton. In contrast, Enriquez et al. (2017) visualized the spreading of a laser beam on coral skeletons and argued that high scattering in coral skeletons leads to a high spreading of light. The relationship between light spreading and skeletal scattering is however non-linear and requires detailed quantification of \u03bcs\u2019 values. We illustrate this with a simple Monte Carlo model-based simulation of light propagation and fluence rate (= scalar irradiance) in a coral model (see Supplementary information). Assuming a simple light absorbing medium (i.e. \u03bcs\u2019=0), an incident collimated light beam will attenuate exponentially according to Lambert Beer\u2019s law. All light will be absorbed along the central line of illumination and no lateral spread of light is visible (Fig. S1a,b). Using a low skeletal scattering value (\u03bcs\u2019 = 1 mm\u22121), the fluence rate spreads within the skeleton and can be measured as a high radial reflectance away from the point of illumination (Fig. S1c). In this scenario, (\u03bcs\u2019= 1 \u03bca=0.1 mm\u22121) increasing \u03bcs\u2019 has increased the spread of light. However, increasing \u03bcs\u2019 10 fold to \u03bcs\u2019 = 10 mm\u22121 (e.g. Marcelino et al. 2013), reduces the spread of light (Fig. S1d). Now higher skeletal scattering leads to lower spreading of light, and most of the light is backscattered from a smaller area within the skeleton. Visual observations of intense light spreading of a laser beam from a skeleton do not imply that the scattering coefficient of the skeleton is high (Enriquez et al. 2017).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "bce78c68-cd5f-4a7e-90c3-b350f44d7b53": {"text": "It has been argued that skeletal light scattering plays a key role in enhancing photosynthetic efficiency of corals (Enriquez et al. 2006), which can be disadvantageous during periods of excess irradiance, where the scattered light causes additional stress leading to photoinhibition and loss of symbionts further increasing light stress in the tissue (Marcelino et al., 2013; Teran et al., 2010; Wangpraseurt et al., 2017a). However, it has also been reported that coral tissue scattering can have a central role in affecting coral light propagation and the contribution of skeletal scattering to coral light absorption (Wangpraseurt et al., 2012; Wangpraseurt, 2016; Wangpraseurt et al., 2014). To illustrate the combined role of tissue and skeletal scattering in coral light transport, we developed a set of Monte Carlo simulations based on the optical properties determined in the present study (see Supplementary information). We first used average optical properties, i.e., high tissue scattering and lower skeletal scattering (Table 2). Secondly, the coral tissue scattering was reduced 10-fold to test whether the coral tissue scattering had an effect on light absorption by Chl a. We calculated the intregal of fluence rate in the coral tissue layer, which is proportional to the amount of light absorbed by Chl a. The results show that the scattering properties of the living coral tissue clearly affects how light is concentrated in that layer, leading to an approximate 17% increase in light absorption for the high tissue scattering scenario (Fig S2a). With high coral tissue scattering, the photons are trapped in the coral layer and thus enhance the absorption, while low coral tissue scattering leads to photons passing through the coral layer entering the skeleton, where it is backscattered to the coral tissue layer. The oblique angle of backscatter of diffuse light doubles the opportunity of algae to absorb light compared to the nearly collimated incident sunlight that enters the coral (Enriquez et al. 2005; K\u00fchl and J\u00f8rgensen 1994).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tbl2"]}, "d254c55b-ce3e-4e64-a048-bd47d3f31d07": {"text": "Symbiodinium density controls the absorption of Chl a, and Symbiodnium cell density is highly variable between corals and over time due to e.g. seasonal fluctuations and/or environmental stress (Hoegh-Guldberg and Jones, 1999). Therefore, we also varied the absorption coefficient over a range of values, (\u03bca= 0.001 to 0.050 mm\u22121) corresponding to a range of realistic Chl a concentrations (Teran et al. 2010). Using a high absorption coefficient (\u03bca =0.050 mm\u22121), our Monte Carlo simulations, show that high coral tissue scattering leads to a 6.8 % decrease in light absorbed by Chl a, relative to the low coral tissue scattering scenario (Fig. S2). Thus, depending on Symbiodinium cell density, increasing tissue scattering can increase or decrease light absorption. This is an important finding as it suggests that the role of light scattering in corals has to be evaluated with respect to algal cell density and Chl a content (Fig. S2a,b). Additionally, it is important to consider that a realistic prediction of light absorption by Symbiodinium cells would also require to take into account the structural complexity of both coral tissue (e.g. tissue thickness, surface structure, Symbiodinium distribution, and coral host pigments) (Wangpraseurt et al., 2017b) and skeletons (Enr\u00edquez et al., 2017), which is beyond the scope of the present study.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "7428f53d-d264-4a2c-827a-baad2bb9a255": {"text": "We found no species-specific differences in optical parameters (see Supplementary Table S1, ANOVA p>0.05).

Grouping of optical parameters in coral families showed that the average skeletal scattering ranged between 0.7-0.8 [mm\u22121] and was not significantly different between the four coral families (Figure 7A, ANOVA, p>0.05). Our results show that due to the small scattering power of the skeleton (b=0.17), skeletal scattering varies little with wavelength between 400 nm (\u03bcs\u2019=0.86) and 800 nm (\u03bcs\u2019=0.76).

This approach allows for estimating the reduced scattering coefficient in the locally monitored aragonite structure, while the present approach estimates bulk scattering properties of the skeleton, across the coral surface including the structural complexity of the skeleton and its voids (Fig. S3).

The epidermis, the outermost and photo-protective layer of the skin, is mainly composed of melanocytes and keratinocytes that together create a structural and functional epidermal unit (Fitzpatrick and Breathnach, 1963). Melanocytes are neural crest-derived cells (Christiansen et al., 2000) that extend dendrites to contact up to 40 epidermal keratinocytes (Quevedo, 1972). The main role of melanocytes is to produce the melanin pigments in a specialized organelle, called melanosome, that undergoes maturation from early non-pigmented to late pigmented stages (Raposo and Marks, 2007). The maturing and pigmented melanosome moves towards the tip of the dendrites (Hume et al., 2001, 2007; Wu et al., 1998) to be transferred to keratinocytes where it protects the nuclei against ultra-violet (UV) radiations. In melanocytes, the formation of dendrites, melanosome biogenesis, and synthesis and transfer of melanin to keratinocytes is a tightly coordinated process under the control of UV radiations, keratinocytes-secreted factors and secreted endosomal-derived vesicles called exosomes (Abdel-Malek et al., 1994; Lo Cicero et al., 2015; Hirobe, 2005, 2014). From those, secreted hormones trigger different transduction pathways in melanocytes, including the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway through binding to various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the cell surface (D\u2019Mello et al., 2016; Saldana-Caboverde and Kos, 2011). As a consequence, melanocytes increase pigment synthesis and dendrite outgrowth through regulation of Rho GTPases activity and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (Busc\u00e0 and Ballotti, 2000; Busc\u00e0 et al., 1998; Scott, 2002; Scott and Leopardi, 2003). We have recently shown that specific miRNAs associated with keratinocyte exosomes modulate human melanocyte pigmentation by enhancing the expression of proteins associated with melanosome maturation and trafficking (Lo Cicero et al., 2015). However, how environmental cues are spatially and temporally controlled in melanocytes to be efficiently translated into biochemical and physical cellular responses remains mostly uncharacterized.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "70279a28-a4dd-4266-b701-be8eb602deff": {"text": "Caveolae are cup-shaped plasma membrane invaginations firstly described in endothelial and epithelial cells (Palade, 1953; Yamada, 1955). Their size (50-100 nm) and the absence of an electron-dense coat morphologically distinguish caveolae from other invaginated structures at the plasma membrane (Stan, 2005). Caveolae are mainly composed of two groups of proteins, the caveolins (Cav1, 2 and 3) and the more recently identified cavins (Cavin1, 2, 3 and 4) (Bastiani et al., 2009; Hill et al., 2008; Kurzchalia et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2008; Nishimoto et al., 2002; Rothberg et al., 1992; Way and Parton, 1995). Caveolae biogenesis and functions are dependent on Cav1 and Cavin1 in non-muscle cells, and on Cav3 in muscle cells (Hansen and Nichols, 2010). Caveolae play various crucial functions including endocytosis, lipid homeostasis, signal transduction and, the most recently identified, mechanoprotection (Cheng and Nichols, 2016; Lamaze et al., 2017). As a transduction platform, caveolae control the production of second messengers, such as cAMP, through local confinement of different elements of this signaling cascade (Harvey and Calaghan, 2012). Cav1 and \u22123 contain a scaffolding domain (CSD) located in the N-terminal region suggested to interact with transmembrane adenylate cyclases (tmACs), to inhibit their activities and thus control intracellular cAMP levels (Toya et al., 1998). In cardiomyocytes, caveolae participate in the compartmentalization of intracellular cAMP which can regulate cell contractility in distal regions of the heart and, therefore, its function (Wright et al., 2014, 2018). The mechanoprotective role of caveolae is associated with the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity when both, cells and tissues, experience chronical mechanical stress (Cheng et al., 2015; Lo et al., 2015; Parton et al., 2017; Sinha et al., 2011).

To evaluate the distribution of caveolae within the epidermal unit in 2D, normal human melanocytes and keratinocytes were co-cultured and labelled for the two constituents of caveolae, Cav1 or Cavin1. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both Cav1 and Cavin1, and therefore caveolae, were asymmetrically distributed in melanocytes (), which were identified by the abundant staining of the premelanosome protein PMEL [hereafter referred as melanin, see Experimental Procedures; (Raposo et al., 2001)].

However, in the absence of any type of spatial signaling, cell polarization can occur randomly and spontaneously (Wedlich-Soldner and Li, 2003). When grown alone in the absence of any pre-existent signaling cues, one third of melanocytes presented polarized caveolae, as shown by the asymmetric distribution of endogenous Cav1 and Cavin1 (). This polarization was restricted to caveolae as the distribution of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs; Figure S1B, red), the canonical plasma membrane invaginated-structures mediating endocytosis (Mayor et al., 2014) was even.

Melanocytes express different receptors that activate signal transduction pathways increasing pigmentation (D\u2019Mello et al., 2016; Gordon et al., 1989; Hirobe, 2005, 2014). A key signaling molecule in this process is the second messenger cAMP produced by tmACs downstream of GPCR activation (Busc\u00e0 and Ballotti, 2000). Interestingly, Cav1 and Cav3 can control cAMP production and were suggested to compartmentalize this second messenger (Allen et al., 2009; Calaghan et al., 2008; Wright et al., 2014). We thus investigated whether Cav1 was required for the production of intracellular cAMP following forskolin (FSK) stimulation, a cell-permeable direct activator of tmACs (Litvin et al., 2003; Metzger and Lindner, 1981; Seamon and Daly, 1981).

Several studies have reported that caveolae could regulate the activity of various signaling molecules, mostly in an inhibitory fashion, through direct binding to the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD; Lu et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2017).

Melanin synthesis requires the activity of melanogenic enzymes of the tyrosinase family which include the rate-limiting enzyme Tyrosinase (TYR) and the Dopachrome tautomerase (DCT; Ebanks et al., 2009). In agreement, Cav1-depleted cells showed an enrichment in both TYR and DCT protein levels ( and S2E, F). Within the melanosome, synthesized melanin deposits onto a fibrillar matrix formed upon proteolytic cleavage of the structural protein PMEL (Theos et al., 2005) which expression level remained unchanged in Cav1-depleted melanocytes (Figure S2G). Similarly, the expression of the Rab27a GTPase, which regulates melanosome transport to the cell periphery (Bahadoran et al., 2001), was constant (Figure S2H). These data indicate that Cav1 depletion specifically affects pigment production in melanosomes, but not their structure nor their intracellular peripheral localization, as also evidenced by conventional TEM of siCav1-treated melanocytes (Figure S2I). As pigment production is accompanied by melanosome maturation (Raposo et al., 2001), we used TEM to quantify the early unpigmented (stages I and II) and the mature pigmented melanosomes (stages III and IV) in control and Cav1-depleted melanocytes. Consistent with the biochemical analyses (Figures 2C and D), the number of pigmented stage IV increased significantly with a concomitant decrease in unpigmented stage II in Cav1-depleted melanocytes (Figures 2E and F).

In melanocytes and melanoma cells, the increase of cAMP levels supports dendrite outgrowth (Busc\u00e0 et al., 1998; Nakazawa et al., 1993; Scott and Leopardi, 2003). For the last few years, caveolae mechanosensing and mechanoprotective functions have emerged as a new major features of caveolae in many cell types in vitro and in vivo (Sinha et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2015). In this context, caveolae were recently shown to couple mechanosensing with mechanosignaling in human myotubes (Dewulf et al., 2019). Because Cav1 regulates cAMP levels in melanocytes, we explored the role of caveolae in the mechanical behavior of melanocytes in response to chemical stimulation. Cav1-depleted melanocytes (Figure S3A) were grown in three different media: devoid of stimulating molecules (poor medium), containing forskolin (poor medium + FSK) or supplemented with different growth factors (supplemented medium; see Experimental procedures). The shape of the cells was analyzed using fluorescently-labelled phalloidin that stained actin filaments (). In the absence of signaling molecules (poor medium), control and Cav1-depleted melanocytes preferentially displayed a similar morphology characterized by the presence of at most two protrusions (Figures 3A and B). Chemical stimulation of control melanocytes increased the number of protrusions, while the majority of Cav1-depleted cells did not extend more than two protrusions (Figures 3A and B). We then characterized the cell morphology by measuring the cell area, major and minor axis and by calculating the length-to-width ratio ( and S3B-D). Without chemical stimulation, the length-to-width ratio was similar in control- and Cav1-depleted melanocytes. After stimulation, the area of the cell and the minor axis, but not the major axis, increased in control cells (Figures S3B-D). This caused a slight decrease in the length-to width ratio (), which reflects cell spreading and formation of dendrite-like protrusions. On the contrary, Cav1-depleted cells responded to stimulation by preserving the cell area (Figure S3C) which confirms their elongated shape. Moreover, the major axis increased while the minor axis increased (Figures S3C and D). This increased dramatically the length-to-width ratio in Cav1-depleted melanocytes () and suggests that cell spreading is mainly occurring along the major axis. Therefore, the sole elevation of intracellular cAMP in melanocytes devoid of caveolae is not sufficient to support the outgrowth of protrusions.

To test if caveolae are involved in the change of morphology of melanocytes that occur in response to keratinocytes-secreted factors, we performed time-lapse microscopy of melanocytes co-cultured with keratinocytes. In the absence of direct cell contact with keratinocytes, control melanocytes responded dynamically by extending and retracting dendrite-like protrusions along time (Video 2). On the contrary, Cav1-depleted melanocytes displayed an elongated shape and formed fewer projections (Video 3). The difference of response due to the absence of caveolae was better evidenced by delineating the cell boundaries during the 4h acquisition () and consistent with the immunofluorescence microscopy data obtained for stimulated melanocytes in monoculture (). Besides the established role of extracellular signaling molecules, direct contact between melanocytes and keratinocytes might also promote dendrite outgrowth (Kippenberger et al., 1998). So, we tested if caveolae could contribute to changes in the morphology of the melanocytes in response to cell-cell interactions with keratinocytes. Control melanocytes responded by extending and retracting dendrite-like protrusions when keratinocytes established close contacts (Video 4), while Cav1-depleted melanocytes were mostly unresponsive to the contacts made by keratinocytes, formed fewer projections and displayed an elongated shape (Video 5). Interestingly, Cav1-depleted melanocytes were more frequently deprived of physical contact by keratinocytes during the total time of acquisition (). In contrast, the frequency of melanocytes-keratinocytes contacts that were long-lasting (1-4h) decreased ( and Videos 4 and 5). Thus, melanocytes devoid of caveolae are unable to promote the outgrowth of protrusions in response to the keratinocytes-secreted factors or to the direct contact with keratinocytes.

Under mechanical stress, caveolae serve as a membrane reservoir by disassembling rapidly to buffer variations of plasma membrane tension (Sinha et al., 2011). To address whether the mechanical function of caveolae is involved during the changes in morphology, and thus membrane tension variations, we monitored the resistance of the plasma membrane of melanocytes during membrane tension increase induced by hypoosmotic shock. Melanocytes were pre-incubated with the membrane permeant cytoplasmic green-fluorescent dye calcein-AM and exposed to a 30 mOsm hypo-osmotic shock in the presence of propidium iodide (PI), a non-permeant red-fluorescent DNA intercalating agent. A loss of plasma membrane integrity is revealed by a decrease or absence of the calcein-AM signal whilst acquiring a positive signal for propidium iodide.

In this context, caveolin-1 was shown to regulate the activity of some isoforms of tmACs in cells (Gu et al., 2002; Ostrom et al., 2002). The use of the CavTratin peptide in vitro negatively regulated these enzymes with concomitant decrease of cAMP production after stimulation (Toya et al., 1998).

This feature of caveolae might not be only restricted to melanocytes and is likely shared by neural crest-derived cells. Indeed, the modulation of cAMP levels in the vicinity of membrane lipid rafts controls dendritic arborization in mice neurons (Averaimo et al., 2016; Guirland and Zheng, 2007) while neuron-targeted Cav1 enhances branching out of the dendrites (Head et al., 2011; Mandyam et al., 2017).

Endogenous Cav1 and Cavin1, and therefore caveolae, distribute asymmetrically and cell-autonomously in cultured human melanocytes. Polarization of Cav1 and caveolae is observed in different cells during cell migration (Grande-Garc\u00eda and del Pozo, 2008; Navarro et al., 2004). However, cultured melanocytes display a poorly motile behavior, as shown here by time-lapse microscopy, which suggests that caveolae polarization in these cells should perform functions unrelated to cell migration. Melanocytes are likely polarized cells as their shape consists of a cell body facing the basal membrane with multiple dendrites extending upwards and as they express proteins specific of epithelial cells (Valencia et al., 2006).

Here, we establish a correlation between caveolae formation and human skin pigmentation. Caveolae accumulate at melanocyte-keratinocyte interface when the epidermis becomes pigmented while impaired caveolae formation in melanocytes, through Cav1 depletion, decreases melanin transfer in co-culture and reconstructed epidermis. The dendrites of melanocytes are seen as conduits for melanin transfer and points of contact with keratinocytes and, therefore, their plasticity seems important to support these functions. Our results show that caveolae protects the plasma membrane of melanocytes against acute rupture after a mechanical stress thus helping the cells to adjust to tension variations. Several studies illustrate that plasma membrane tension regulates membrane deformations during exo- and endocytosis or changes in cell shape (Dai et al., 1997; Gauthier et al., 2011; Houk et al., 2012; Raucher and Sheetz, 2000). Thus, the dynamic cycle of caveolae mechanics, i.e. disassembly and reassembly, in response to tension variations that occur during melanocytes morphological changes could facilitate both dendrite outgrowth and pigment transfer. Nonetheless, the formation of caveolae and non-caveolae Cav1 clusters could also exert a spatiotemporal control of melanin secretion by favoring the local remodeling of the plasma membrane in response to signaling cues.

In melanoma, Cav1 function remains very controversial, since it is recognized as a tumor suppressor and an oncogene (Felicetti et al., 2009; Trimmer et al., 2010). Such discrepancy might be explained by the variations of Cav1 expression during disease progression, as the balance between caveolae signaling and mechanical functions in response to the extracellular environment changes during tumor mass growth (Lin et al., 2007).

Such an intrinsic cost is known in single-gene mutants regarding disease (Tian et al., 2003), herbivory (Sato et al., 2019a; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011), and herbicide resistance (Purrington and Bergelson, 1999; Roux et al., 2004) in A. thaliana. For example, csr1-1 and ixr1-2 mutants, which gain resistance to acetolactate synthase or cellulose synthase inhibitors, exhibit 36-44% reduction in total silique production in the absence of herbicide (Roux et al., 2004), suggesting negative pleiotropic effects due to the alteration of physiological process. Similar to these findings, we report here the intrinsic cost of a response pathway resulting in abiotic stress tolerance, the UVR8-mediated UV-B response. The absolute value of its fitness cost is comparable to previous studies and depended on measured fitness components and on growth conditions owing to the inducible nature of the response. In the UV-B-exclusion conditions, no significant differences in fitness components of wild types and uvr8 mutants of different Arabidopsis backgrounds were detected, suggesting negligible induction of UV-B responses. Differences were pronounced in conditions with UV-B levels corresponding to approximately 1.5% of natural UV-B irradiation, but in the presence of a more significant stressor, i.e. sunlight in Zurich, no significant difference was detected. Furthermore, in contrast to naturally occurring mutations in herbicide resistance and herbivore defense, UVR8 is generally highly conserved (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2016).

We would like to note that the data alone cannot establish if UV-B irradiation was directly responsible for the lethality observed in the Mountain cohort. The total amount of UV irradiation in the alpine environment is subject to large fluctuations and may not have been greater than that in Zurich (Blumthaler, 2012).

Keratinocytes (KCs), the major cell type of the epidermis, undergo a program of differentiation whereby they transit out of the proliferative basal cell layer and exit the cell cycle, giving rise to suprabasal layers (spinous, granular, and stratum corneum) (Jensen and Proksch, 2009; Proksch ). Melanocytes (MCs), the pigment producing cells of the epidermis, reside within the basal layer of the skin. Through the extension of dendrites, MCs interact with KCs in a ratio of roughly 36 KCs: 1 MC, forming the KC:MC pigmentary unit (Nguyen and Fisher, 2018; Weiner ). KCs and MCs directly associate through cadherin-based adhesive structures and indirectly communicate via paracrine signaling (Lee and Herlyn, 2007; Mescher ; Serre ).

Activation of the MC transcription factor MITF in response to secretion of KC-derived factors (e.g. \u03b1\u2013MSH, KITL, ET1; Melanocyte stimulating hormone, Kit ligand, Endothelin 1) following UV exposure results in upregulation of melanin-producing enzymes (including TRP1; Tyrosinase related protein 1), and melanin production and secretion (Nguyen and Fisher, 2018; Serre ). UV exposure also initiates signaling cascades in both KCs and MCs, resulting in secretion of cytokines and chemokines including interleukins (IL1, 3, 6, 8), interferon (IFN\u03b3), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) (Schwarz and Luger, 1989; Terazawa and Imokawa, 2018; Yoshizumi ), all of which control multicellular reactions such as the tanning response within the KC:MC unit.

Outside of its adhesive function, Dsg1 is an important regulator of cellular signaling, specifically in attenuating the MAPK/ERK pathway to promote KC differentiation (Getsios ; Harmon ).

Variability in light environments of a plant or leaf caused by clouds or canopy shading can often result in rapid switching between limited or excess light exposure in relation to the acclimated state. Excess light can result in the production of damaging reactive oxygen species, which can impair leaf photosynthesis even after return to low light. Plants have evolved a method to dissipate excess light energy from the major light-harvesting antennae as heat through a photoprotective mechanism known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ; Reviewed in Ruban, 2016). This process can eliminate over 75% of absorbed light energy (Niyogi, Grossman, & Bjorkman, 1998) and modified regulation of NPQ has been shown to improve photosynthetic efficiency and increase biomass in field-grown tobacco (Kromdijk et al., 2016).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "c7ae2277-042d-4804-917a-f67a0df7c462": {"text": "In vascular plants, the NPQ mechanism is generally classified into two main components: energy-dependent quenching (qE) and photoinhibition quenching (qI; Ruban, 2016). qE is recognized as the most significant component of NPQ and can be rapidly increased and relaxed within seconds to minutes. qE is triggered by a decrease in the thylakoid lumen pH (Briantais, Vernotte, Picaud, & Krause, 1979), which induces thermal dissipation through protonation of the PsbS protein, as well as the serial de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and then zeaxanthin through the xanthophyll cycle (Reviewed in Demmig-Adams & Adams, 1992; Jahns & Holzwarth, 2012). Conformational changes in the light-harvesting antennae activated during qE involve monomerization of PsbS (Correa-Galvis, Poschmann, Melzer, Stuhler, & Jahns, 2016; X. P.

GWAS surveys a much wider range of genetic diversity than bi-parental populations and also provides greater resolution for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) to assist in gene discovery.

For example, plants grown in inland conditions had consistently faster induction of NPQ when exposed to actinic light, which suggests the relatively more stressful growing environment has primed these plants to more rapidly respond to stressful conditions. Furthermore, all plants in all conditions rapidly resolved their NPQ when moved to darkness, though inland-grown 16-leaf plants did so more quickly. The steady decrease in NPQ observed in the inland-grown 16-leaf plants during their exposure to actinic light also suggests they are better acclimated to utilise abiotic stress response pathways. Differences in glutathione content between inland- and coastal-grown plants may be a potential mechanism for this observation as glutathione is a potent antioxidant that fluctuates with light intensity (Alsharafa et al., 2014). However, more research must be done to confirm this.

Corals rely heavily on photosynthesis by their dinoflagellate endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) to meet their metabolic requirements (Muscatine 1990). The distribution of reef-building corals is therefore constrained by the availability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm), which is in turn determined by physical factors such as latitude, seasonality, water depth and the optical properties of the water body (Kirk 1994; Kleypas et al. 1999; L\u00f3pez-Londo\u00f1o et al. 2021). Variability in these parameters affects both the quantity and spectral quality of irradiance, exposing corals to a large range of light environments even across small spatial scales (Brakel 1979; Anthony and Hoegh-Guldberg 2003; Eyal et al. 2015). On shallow reef flats in clear water regions, corals are routinely exposed to excess irradiance that supersaturates symbiont photosynthesis (Jimenez et al. 2012; Wangpraseurt et al. 2014b), with short light flashes reaching over 3900 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121 due to the lensing effect of waves (Veal et al. 2010). Additionally, shallow water corals are exposed to a broad irradiance spectrum covering ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) radiation (Wangpraseurt et al. 2014b). At the other extreme, photosynthetic corals on mesophotic reefs at water depths between 50-150 m can receive as little as 1% of surface PAR, largely concentrated in the blue-green region of the spectrum and greatly reduced for UV and red wavebands (Lesser et al. 2009; Eyal et al. 2015; Tamir et al. 2019). Light conditions can also vary for individual colonies from the same water depth depending on colony morphology (Kaniewska et al. 2011; Wangpraseurt et al. 2014b) and the reef structure that surrounds them (Falkowski and Dubinsky 1981; Wangpraseurt et al. 2014b).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "00f59f1c-fbf1-4960-9de3-1c89fa6ec670": {"text": "Corals have evolved a number of mechanisms for optimising symbiont photosynthesis in the presence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in light availability. Some of these mechanisms occur at the symbiont cell level, while others involve changes in coral host morphology both at the colony and polyp-scale (Kramer et al.; Hoogenboom et al. 2008; Todd 2008). Coral symbionts can modify their light harvesting and energy quenching over timescales ranging from seconds to months. For example, non-photochemical quenching allows rapid dissipation of excess irradiance in the photosynthetic apparatus of symbionts, preventing photodamage in high light environments (Hoegh-Guldberg and Jones 1999; Gorbunov et al. 2001). Changes in photosynthetic pigment concentrations and symbiont cell numbers enable corals to acclimate to changes in irradiance over longer time periods (Falkowski and Dubinsky 1981; Titlyanov et al. 2001); specifically, corals can increase their symbiont numbers as well as the per cell photosynthetic pigment content in response to a reduction in light levels, and vice versa (Falkowski and Dubinsky 1981; Titlyanov et al. 2001).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "c9207d59-ebda-47da-bd3b-12644e545f9a": {"text": "Coral host morphology is an important factor controlling the irradiance available for symbiont photosynthesis (Helmuth et al. 1997; Ralph et al. 2002; Einbinder et al. 2009; Kaniewska et al. 2011; Nir et al. 2011; Wangpraseurt et al. 2014b; Kahng et al. 2019). Coral colonies from low light environments maximize their interception with the downwelling irradiance and assume plate-like morphologies that are more conducive to light gathering, while shallow water colonies assume more self-shading morphologies, such as vertical plates or branches (Anthony et al. 2005; Kaniewska et al. 2011). Morphological adaptations make some species depth-specialists, such as the mesophotic coral Leptoseris which can host photosynthetic symbionts down to depths of well over 100 m (Rouz\u00e9 et al. 2021). Growth form can also exhibit a great degree of phenotypic plasticity in many coral species, as evident from changes in morphology when colonies are transplanted across depth gradients (Willis 1985; Tamir et al. 2020).

These pigments accumulate in high concentration in colony parts with low symbiont densities, often areas of active growth, such as skeletal ridges, the tips of branching corals, the margins of plating corals, and areas affected by epibionts and mechanical damage (Salih et al. 2000; D\u2019Angelo et al. 2012).

Upregulation of these pigments in growing parts of colonies and in bleached tissue has been proposed to promote (re)colonisation of host tissue by symbiont cells via the reduction of internal light stress in areas with low symbiont densities (D\u2019Angelo et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2013; Bollati et al. 2020). GFP-like proteins are also widely distributed in corals that are depth generalists or even mesophotic specialists (Oswald et al. 2007; Eyal et al. 2015), where they are constitutively expressed, often at high levels, across a wide range of irradiance regimes (Leutenegger et al. 2007). It has long been proposed that fluorescent pigments in low light habitats could enhance coral photosynthesis by modulating the spectrum and intensity of light that reaches the symbiont cells (Schlichter et al. 1994; Salih et al. 2000). A light-enhancement mechanism has been suggested for a particular group of constitutive GFP-like proteins known as photoconvertible RFPs (pcRFPs), which are common in thick-tissue depth generalist and mesophotic coral species (Ando et al. 2002; Wiedenmann et al. 2004; Oswald et al. 2007; Eyal et al. 2015). pcRFPs emit green fluorescence when first synthesised, but their chromophores are irreversibly converted to a red-emitting species upon absorption of a UV photon ~390 nm (Ando et al. 2002; Wiedenmann et al. 2004). As coral GFP-like proteins are typically arranged in tetramers, UV-induced post-translational modification leads to the formation of tetramers that contain both green and red subunits; they can therefore absorb light in the blue-green range and re-emit it in the orange-red range via highly efficient F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between adjacent subunits (Wiedenmann et al. 2004; Bollati et al. 2017).

Depending on the scattering strength of the two compartments, light in deeper aboral tissue layers can be strongly reduced (Wangpraseurt et al. 2012) or enhanced (Szab\u00f3 et al. 2014; Wangpraseurt et al. 2020), relative to the top (oral) tissue layers. Our measurements of the tissue attenuation coefficient for M. cavernosa indicate shading of the deeper tissue areas, particularly in the violet-blue range (Fig. 1b). Additionally, previous measurements of optical scattering suggest that light enhancement due to skeleton backscatter is limited for this species compared to other coral taxa (Marcelino et al. 2013). While these properties may confer bleaching resistance and provide photoprotection for the symbiont population in shallow water (Wangpraseurt et al. 2012; Marcelino et al. 2013), tissue shading greatly reduces carbon fixation rates in symbiont cells found in deeper tissue layers (Wangpraseurt et al. 2016b), which might negatively affect colonies in light-limited environments; yet, M. cavernosa is able to thrive at mesophotic depths (Lesser et al. 2010). At the coral surface, spectral changes due to conversion of the pcRFP pool were observed at the absorption and emission peaks of the green (507 and 514 nm) and red chromophore (571 and 582 nm) (Fig. 1a). Surface light enhancement by GFP-like proteins in corals can be attributed to a combination of elastic scattering (i.e. scattering without modifications of photon energy) and inelastic scattering (i.e. scattering with modification of photon energy, such as the case of absorption followed by fluorescence emission) (Lyndby et al. 2016). Under white light, the degree of photoconversion of the pcRFP pool did not appear to significantly affect the spectral attenuation coefficient (Fig. 1b), indicating that the effects of pcRFP scattering on attenuation of the incident are relatively small compared to the effects of tissue scattering and photosynthetic pigment absorption. Host pigment-derived enhancement of light in pcRFP-containing corals in shallow water environments therefore appears a minor component for the overall tissue light microclimate, albeit with some variability due to water depth and the optical properties of the water column, as well as spectral differences between our white measuring light and sunlight.

Therefore, it was proposed that orange fluorescence emission by pcRFPs could provide an energetic advantage for symbiotic corals in greater water depths dominated by blue light (Smith et al. 2017) Indeed, colour morphs with pcRFPs survived longer than non-pigmented conspecifics in simulated deep water light environments (Smith et al. 2017). Here, we directly quantified the impact of pcRFPs on the light environment experienced by deep symbionts in hospite in corals. We used the blue light excited fluorescence emission profiles from M. cavernosa (Fig. 2c) at different stages of photoconversion (Fig. 3a-c) to calculate the number of photons generated by fluorescence emission integrated over the green (Fig. 3d) and red (Fig. 3e) spectral range. Fluorescence emission by a converted pcRFP pool provides an amount of orange-red photons that ranges between 1% (close to the skeleton) and 5% (at the coral surface) of the blue incident intensity, with intermediate values of around 3% at a tissue depth of 400 \u03bcm (Fig. 3e). This is a more than three times higher contribution by the converted pcRFP, as compared to measurements in the same waveband on unconverted coral. Our direct measurements of the coral tissue light field thus provide experimental proof that orange-red fluorescence from host pigments penetrates coral tissues better than green fluorescence, and that ectodermal pcRFPs can improve the illumination of otherwise shaded tissue areas despite the narrow mesophotic light spectrum. Thus, under a mesophotic light spectrum, the symbionts harboured by conspecific fluorescent morphs experience a spectrally different light environment depending on the pigment complement expressed by their host (Ben-Zvi et al. 2021).

While this type of skeletal structure can help healthy corals optimise photosynthesis, during bleaching this can amplify the irradiance increase derived from the loss of photosynthetic pigment absorption (Enr\u00edquez et al. 2005; Marcelino et al. 2013; Wangpraseurt et al. 2017). Our data confirms that bleached P. damicornis tissue indeed experiences a strongly light enhancing microenvironment, resulting from enhanced skeletal scattering due to reduced tissue absorption (Wangpraseurt et al. 2017). Such strongly enhanced light microhabitat can also be found in healthy corals such as in the growing plate margins of M. foliosa, where the symbiont population is less abundant compared to the inner areas (Fig. 5d). While blue light is attenuated in unbleached corals, the absence of symbionts in bleached corals or tissue areas with low symbiont densities (e.g. in areas of active tissue growth), results in the enhancement of blue light possibly leading to transcriptional upregulation of CPs (D\u2019Angelo et al. 2008). This supports the notion that the optical feedback loop is a key mechanism underlying the colourful bleaching phenomenon (Bollati et al. 2020).

Thus, optimisation of the light microenvironment by CPs in symbiont-depleted tissue could provide the necessary conditions for (re) colonisation by symbiont cells (D\u2019Angelo et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2013; Bollati et al. 2020).", "figure_ref": ["fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "64c684d1-dc64-486e-a99b-eaa2b5301fc1": {"text": "While the pcRFPs and CPs examined in this study are characterised by very different optical properties, environmental regulation and ecological distribution, both coral host pigments can regulate internal light fluxes in the orange-red spectral range.

On the other hand, light amplification in symbiont-free tissue produces excess irradiance in this waveband, which can cause photodamage unless counteracted by CP screening or other photoprotective mechanisms (Smith et al. 2013; Wijgerde et al. 2014; Wangpraseurt et al. 2017; Quick et al. 2018). Spectral regulation by GFP-like host pigments is thus a flexible mechanism to achieve fine spectral regulation of the intra-tissue light field of corals, enabling them to optimise light capture for their algal symbionts in response to environmental light gradients.

This mechanism may be complemented by the action of a copper oxidase necessary for converting Cu [I] to Cu [II], which is more biologically inert and tend to remain in the periplasm. It is also interesting the presence of a gene matching a recently discovered family of copper-binding proteins involved in cytosolic copper storage (Dennison et al., 2018). On the other hand, the indirect mechanisms would involve the participation of genes whose actions compensate for specific damage caused by toxic copper.

However, the complexity of human exposure levels to solar UV as a function of solar zenith angle, seasonality, spectral distribution, and latitude remain to be addressed before any firm conclusions relevant to human populations can be drawn. Specifically, the anti-viral activity of specific spectral components of sUV remains to be determined since the light source employed in our prototype studies emitted full spectrum simulated solar UV, and the action spectrum of virus inactivation by solar UV remains largely undefined. For example, it is possible that the UVA portion of ground level sUV significantly contributes to the coronavirus-directed effects described by us [7]. It therefore remains to be seen if indirect impairment of viral structure and infectivity occurs by alternative mechanisms, such as UVA-driven photosensitization and oxidative stress (mediated by formation of reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen), that might be operative in addition to direct inactivation of viral genomic RNA through nucleic acid base photodamage. It will also be interesting to explore potential mechanistic synergisms underlying virucidal effects that occur upon combined UVA and UVB as compared to separate spectral exposure.

Pollen grains accumulate flavonoids to protect them from UV-B damage and preserve their viability after anthesis [32], whereas flavonoids protect ovules by shielding ovaries from UV radiation [33]. In the same way, the accumulation of protective flavonoids in petals and sepals can reduce the damaging effects of UV radiation on these and other nearby reproductive tissues [34]. Additionally, petal flavonoids form a UV pigmentation floral pattern to guide pollinators to nectaries, thus UV-induced changes in the size of nectar guides might affect the pollination activity [1,35]. In addition, UV radiation may induce a variety of plant morphological responses in these reproductive structures. Many studies have reported a complex UV dose-response involving differential effects on reproductive morphological traits (reviewed in [7]).

In this species, all anthocyanins in aboveground tissues are cyanidin derivatives, whereas the most abundant flavones are apigenin derivatives (isovitexin) in petals and luteolin derivatives (isoorientin) in photosynthetic tissues [38]. Isoorientins are dihydroxy B-ring-substituted flavonoids, which it is known to have higher antioxidant properties [14,51\u201353]. In this regard, the UV-induced accumulation of efficient antioxidant flavonoids has been previously described in plants. For example, the flavonoid composition in leaves of the white clover (Trifolium repens) is affected by solar radiation, as the concentration of quercetin increases under UV-B stress rather than those of less effective antioxidants such as monohydroxylated kaempferol glycosides [54]. In addition, most anthocyanins and flavones in S. littorea are acylated [38], which it is known to enhance the flavonoid absorption in the UV-A and UV-B wavelength [28,55,56]. In Cistus salvifolius, for example, the occurrence of acylated flavonoids in trichomes ameliorates stress from excess UV radiation [57], whereas leaves of purple basil (Ocimum basilicum) accumulate coumaroyl anthocyanins that are more responsive to quenching sunlight irradiance, mainly in the UV-B wavelength, than non-acylated anthocyanins [27]. Although we did not obtain direct evidences of variations of the flavonoid-mediate quenching of UV-induced free radicals in S. littorea, its flavonoid profile, including acylated and efficient antioxidant flavonoids, suggests that this species show a robust biochemical toolkit that may protect itself from the oxidative stress caused by UV radiation.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "da77d4ab-95ea-41c9-9797-004d888a8f00": {"text": "Despite differences in flavonoid production caused by UV radiation, plants not exposed to UV light accumulated important amounts of anthocyanins and flavones in most aboveground tissues. This may be due to the incidence of high levels of PAR on these plants. Several studies indicate that UV irradiance is not a prerequisite for flavonoid biosynthesis. For example, the concentration of UV-absorbing quercetin in Brassica oleracea increases in line with PAR levels [58]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, PAR-only exposure contributes to the formation of a base amount of quercetin, providing a basic photoprotection that is further increased by long term exposure to UV-A/B radiation [59]. Similarly, high levels of PAR might lead to the formation of a base amount of anthocyanins and flavones in S. littorea, whose concentrations could be optimized and increased when plants are exposed to UV radiation. However, given that anthocyanins and flavones perform a plethora of protective functions against many biotic and abiotic factors [28,60,61], they could be performing non-photoprotective functions. For example, isoorientins and isovitexins found in flax (Linum usitatissimum) enhance the resistance to fungal infections [62], and petal isovitexins of Silene latifolia help regulate vacuole homeostasis in epidermal cells, preventing petals from wilting [63]. In addition, flavones are produced constitutively in aboveground tissues of S. littorea when plants grow in low light levels conditions [40]. Thus, although anthocyanins and flavones are probably conferring protection against high levels of PAR, we cannot rule out that the selective pressures of other biotic and abiotic agents could explain the constitutive accumulation of flavonoids found in plants not exposed to UV stress.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "1c6d58e6-45e0-48b8-9ca8-3831886147e0": {"text": "The increase of flavonoid accumulation in response to UV radiation was not homogeneous across tissues: petals respond to UV by increasing anthocyanins, calyces and leaves respond by increasing flavones, and stems through both anthocyanin and flavones.

The depletion of anthocyanins in petals en el UV-absent treatment is translated in a change color intensity [65], which may be differentially perceived by the insect pollinators [66]. On the other hand, calyces of plants from both UV-exclusion and UV-present treatments of Sines population showed higher levels of flavones than those of Furnas in each treatment. This difference may reflect a local adaptation of flavones biosynthesis to the higher UV radiation of the Sines population compared with Furnas [39].

In plants, when incident light surpasses the energy assimilated by the photosynthetic apparatus, the excessive energy causes photoinhibition and the formation of ROS, which results in photo-oxidative damage and an eventual decline in photosynthetic activity [15,28,68]. The photoprotection mechanism of plants involves a variety of defense agents against light-induced ROS, including the synthesis of antioxidant anthocyanins and flavonoids [12,13]. In this regard, dihydroxy B-ring-substituted flavonoids located in the chloroplasts help antioxidant enzymes to reduce light-induced ROS and those diffusing out of the chloroplast are scavenged by vacuolar flavonoids [15]. In addition, leaves accumulating anthocyanins incur in less photoinhibition after a saturating light stress as compared with green leaves [27,69]. We hypothesized that flavonoids (both anthocyanins and flavones) of S. littorea may contribute to photoprotection to thrive in habitats with highly solar radiation such as coastal foredunes along the Iberian Peninsula [39].

Although many studies often report enhanced flowering when plants were exposed to supplemental UV radiation (e.g. [72,73]), other studies have reported the opposite effect.

Thus, despite the fact that absolute fruit production was almost four times higher in plants shielded from UV light, the elevated number of flowers of these plants not visited by pollinator may have led to a reduced fruit set.

Thus, ovule production is less likely to be compromised by solar radiation since ovules are protected from UV radiation by several layers of tissue.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "c12ad965-19af-433c-8765-0f59d225193f": {"text": "UV radiation incurred a trade-off between flavonoid protection and reproduction in S. littorea. We propose that flavonoid production was activated as a defense mechanism against UV radiation, presumably because of their antioxidant nature, which may prevent the chronic photoinhibition and promote a rapid photosynthetic recovery. Conversely, exposure to UV radiation negatively affected flower and pollen production in this species. This balancing between protection and reproduction may be beneficial to successfully survive in exposed coastal foredunes. Thus, the allocation of metabolic resources may provide an efficient photoprotective toolkit and, at the same time, guarantee the reproduction of this species in Mediterranean climates subjected to strong UV radiation.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}}, "10.1101/2020.02.10.942334": {"955b6bb6-56df-433c-acb1-6fb5f12002c1": {"text": "Light provides the energy driving photosynthesis and it is an important cue controlling many physiological processes in phototrophic organisms. In the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor COP1/SPA is a master switch of light signaling, by repressing the accumulation of various transcription factors required for the induction of light-dependent processes like photomorphogenesis or flowering in darkness. Repression is achieved by ubiquitination of target transcription factors and their subsequent proteasomal degradation (Deng et al., 1991; Deng et al., 1992; Chen et al., 2006; Lau and Deng, 2012). Red, blue and UV light perception inactivate the COP1/SPA E3 ligase and relieve repression, by several different mechanisms (Podolec and Ulm, 2018). The bZIP transcription factor HY5 is among the prime targets of COP1-mediated repression and activates photomorphogenesis downstream of phytochrome, cryptochrome and UV-B photoreceptors (Gangappa and Botto, 2016). It is also the downstream effector of other signaling cascades and estimated to directly control \u223c3000 genes in Arabidopsis (Lee et al., 2007). Among the light-dependent processes vital for microalgal cells is non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which helps to relieve photosystem excitation pressure under conditions that are sub-optimal for photosynthesis, thereby preventing damage to the photosynthetic apparatus (Wobbe et al., 2016). In the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a well-established phototrophic model organism, energy-dependent quenching (qE), an NPQ process essential for survival under excess light conditions, requires LHCSR3 (Peers et al., 2009) and PSBS (Tibiletti et al., 2016; Correa-Galvis et al., 2016) proteins, which accumulate upon exposure to high light (Peers et al., 2009) or UV-B radiation (Tilbrook et al., 2016). High light-induction of LHCSR3 accumulation depends on the blue-light photoreceptor phototropin (Petroutsos et al., 2016), while UV-B induction of PSBS and LHCSR1 proceeds via the UVR8 photoreceptor, probably interacting with Cr-COP1, whose absence from algal cells perturbs UV-B acclimation (Allorent et al., 2016; Tilbrook et al., 2016). Cr-COP1 was originally identified in a high light-tolerant C. reinhardtii mutant named hit1 (high light tolerant 1) as LRS1 (putative Light Response Signaling protein; Phytozome v5.5 identifier Cre02.g085050) (Schierenbeck et al., 2015) and transformation with LRS1 restored UV-B acclimation in the Arabidopsis UVR8 mutant (Tilbrook et al., 2016), demonstrating that LRS1 (Cr-COP1) is the microalgal homolog of Arabidopsis COP1. The mutant hit1 carries a point mutation in gene LRS1, which causes a proline to arginine exchange within the WD40 domain of protein LRS1 (Schierenbeck et al., 2015). Mutant hit1 originated from a mutagenesis approach based on UV treatment followed by subsequent mutant selection under high light conditions. Thus, mutant hit1 displays a high light-tolerant phenotype, explicable by an elevated NPQ capacity (Schierenbeck et al., 2015). In the screen another high light tolerant strain hit2 was identified, whose genome also contains a point mutation in the gene LRS1 (Schierenbeck et al., 2015) and which is less susceptible to photoinhibition than a wild-type (Virtanen et al., 2019). A recent study indicated the implication of a CUL4-DDB1DET1 E3 ligase complex in the control of LHCSR and PSBS gene expression in C. reinhardtii, but the effectors acting downstream of the complex remained elusive (Aihara et al., 2019). In Arabidopsis the CUL4-DDB1DET1 complex acts as an ubiquitin ligase, but how this complex interacts with the COP1-containing complex (CUL4-DDB1COP1-SPA1) is unknown (Dong et al., 2015). Two other recent studies demonstrated that the high light-induced accumulation of PSBS and LHCSR proteins requires a homolog of the A. thaliana transcription factor CONSTANS, negatively regulated by a CrCOP1-SPA1 E3-ubiquitin ligase and activated by UV-B perception via UVR8 (Gabilly et al., 2019; Tokutsu et al., 2019). However, work from Allorent et al (Allorent et al., 2016) demonstrated that LHCSR3 accumulation under high light does not require UVR8, whereas a clear dependence on PHOT was demonstrated by Petroutsos et al (Petroutsos et al., 2016). It was thus suggested that blue light perception via phototropin controls LHCSR3 accumulation, while LHCSR1 and PSBS are regulated via UVR-8 (Allorent et al., 2016). In contrast to previous studies, which identified signaling components via forward genetics screens, we took a distinct approach based on regulatory network construction and transcriptomics followed by reverse genetics. Overall, this approach led to the identification of a novel key mechanism of photoprotection control, repressing LHCSR3 transcription in the absence of light.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "53f11706-6396-4923-9cfb-3400d65d54b8": {"text": "In a previous study, a constitutive high non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity of hit strains could be demonstrated as an explanation for their extreme high light tolerance (Schierenbeck et al., 2015). To get further insights into the type of NPQ altered in mutant hit1, NPQ induction was recorded for the mutant and the wild-type strain (Fig. 1a), following photoautotrophic growth at moderate high light (400 \u00b5mol photons m-2\u00b7s-1). The mutant showed an elevated quenching capacity already within the first seconds of the measurement, which rapidly relaxed in darkness (Fig. 1a; red circles). This indicated that the main NPQ type affected in hit1 is energy-dependent quenching qE, which is activated within a few seconds and relaxes very quickly in the absence of light (Wobbe et al., 2016). In the green microalga C. reinhardtii, efficient energy-dependent quenching requires the proteins LHCSR3 (Peers et al., 2009) and LHCSR1 (Dinc et al., 2016) besides PSBS (Correa-Galvis et al., 2016; Tibiletti et al., 2016), whose accumulation is induced by light stress (Peers et al., 2009; Maruyama et al., 2014). In addition to light, the supply of inorganic and organic carbon regulates the accumulation of LHCSR proteins, with LHCSR3 light induction being repressed by high inorganic/organic carbon supply, whereas LHCSR1 accumulation is unaffected (Polukhina et al., 2016). Similar to LHCSR3, PSBS accumulation is repressed when cells are exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide (Correa-Galvis et al., 2016). Therefore, cultivation of a C. reinhardtii wild-type at low light intensities (Fig. 1b; LL; PCS) and with the simultaneous presence of acetate in the growth medium prevented the accumulation of LHCSR protein, while LHCSR accumulated in mutant hit1, grown under identical conditions. An increase in light intensity (Fig. 1b; MHL) used for cultivation was accompanied by an accumulation of LHCSR in the parental control strain (PCS). The extent of LHCSR accumulation in hit1 under these conditions was, however, much higher. Similarly, LHCSR1 accumulated to higher levels in hit1 vs. wild-type (Fig. 1b; \u03b1LHCSR1; MHL). In these conditions, PSBS could be immunodetected in samples of hit1, but not in those of the wild-type (\u03b1PSBS). Exposure to darkness abolished LHCSR accumulation in the parental control strain but not in mutant hit1 (Fig. 1b; dark), while PSBS could not be detected in either of the two cell lines. To analyze, whether the accumulation of photoprotective proteins in hit1 cells is due to an increased level of the respective transcript, RT-Q-PCR analyses were conducted (Fig. 1c). The mRNA of genes LHCSR3.1/3.2 accumulated to much higher levels in hit1 compared to its parental strain (84.7 \u00b1 7.9 in hit1 vs. parental strain set to 1) and a similar trend could be observed for the mRNA encoding PSBS1 (Fig 3b; 994 \u00b1 200 vs. 1 in parental strain). It can therefore be concluded that essential components of the qE mechanism, active in C. reinhardtii, are constitutively expressed in the mutant hit1 (Fig. 1b and c). When moderate light stress is applied, LHCSR proteins accumulate in hit1 to much higher levels than in the parental strain (Fig. 1b and c). COP1, the higher plant homolog of LRS1 is known to be part of a Cullin-based ubiquitin E3 ligase (CUL4-DDB1COP1-SPA) complex, repressing the transcription of various genes, whose encoded proteins are only required in the light. Given that the role of COP1 within the signaling mechanisms underlying ultraviolet light acclimation is highly conserved between the higher plant A. thaliana and the green microalga C. reinhardtii (Schierenbeck et al., 2015; Tilbrook et al., 2016; Aihara et al., 2019; Gabilly et al., 2019; Tokutsu et al., 2019), it seems reasonable to assume that LRS1 functions as a repressor of light-induced genes in dark-acclimated C. reinhardtii cells.", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig1", "fig1", "fig1", "fig1", "fig1", "fig1", "fig3", "fig1", "fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "204d8855-5970-4480-9e26-ca8bec868af8": {"text": "a, NPQ induction in phototrophically-grown (400 pmol photons m2 s1 continuous light) parental control strain (PCS; wild-type cc124; black curve) and mutant hit1 (red curve).

Random forest based regression (Huynh-Thu et al., 2010) predicted interaction partners of LRS1 based on 976 transcriptome samples of wild-type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in public databases (Supplemental Table 1). While COP1-mediated gene repression in A. thaliana is known to primarily rely on post-translational processes (Deng et al., 1991; Deng et al., 1992; Chen et al., 2006; Lau and Deng, 2012), we hypothesized that feed-back and feed-forward loops extend to the transcriptome and make it accessible to analysis. The regulatory network predicted by machine learning contained 225941 edges, connecting 17331 nodes. To test whether the network contained relevant biological information, gene enrichment among target genes was tested for each regulatory factor. For 295 out of 812 regulators, enrichment <10-10 was detected (Supplemental Table 2) indicating that the predicted network contains biological information. First level, i.e. direct interactors of LRS1 and second level interactors were plotted (Figure 3a; top) to illustrate the network connected to LRS1. 69 target genes directly connect to LRS1 of which 4 are regulators themselves. 620 target genes are indirectly coupled to LRS1 via a connected regulator. The first level interactors were significantly enriched in genes, whose expression was altered significantly with a large amplitude in in the hit1 mutant (p<10-30; Figure 3a, b). The prediction of the network has an average precision for LRS1 of 0.68 for a network cutoff of 0.01 (Figure 3c). CrHY5 is predicted to play a central role in this interaction since it is positioned at the center of interaction from LRS1 to its targets (Figure 3a). The significantly upregulated genes with a large amplitude enrich in the targets of CrHY5 (p<10-30). Among the CrHY5 targets predicted by the network are several photoprotection genes (LHCSR3.1, LHCSR1, PSBS2 and other stress-related LHCs; Supplemental Table 3). In addition, other factors required for the induction of energy-dependent quenching via cyclic electron flow such as PGR5 (Johnson et al., 2014) or the synthesis of lutein (FAO5; EC 5.5.1.19 -lycopene beta-cyclase), a xanthophyll implicated in the quenching of excited chlorophyll states (Dall\u2019Osto et al., 2006).

In a wild-type cell (Fig. 6 a; Wt) prolonged darkness should result in the formation of a E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CUL4-DDB1LRS1-SPA, whose existence is indicated by the identification of nuclear Chlamydomonas genes encoding homologs of the respective complex components known from A. thaliana (CUL4/Cre12.g516500; DDB1/Cre10.g432000; SPA/Cre13.g602700; RBX1/Cre12.g543450) and the proven interaction of CUL4/DDB1 in Yeast-Two-Hybrid assays (Aihara et al., 2019). The Chlamydomonas SPA protein (Cre13.g602700) is among the targets of LRS1 predicted by the network analysis (Supplemental Table 4) and up-regulated in hit1 (>2-fold under both conditions). A knock-out of SPA was recently shown to de-regulate photoprotection gene expression (Gabilly et al., 2019), confirming the regulatory role of the LRS1/SPA complex for the control of qE. In the same study, an inactivation of CUL4 (Cre12.g516500) was shown to provoke a similar phenotype. Therefore, the microalgal E3 ligase complex should ubiquitinate transcription factors in analogy to its function in Arabidopsis (Deng et al., 1991; Deng et al., 1992; Chen et al., 2006; Lau and Deng, 2012) and with LRS1/SPA acting as a substrate adaptor.", "figure_ref": ["fig6"], "table_ref": []}, "fb1ea472-50a7-451b-bf6e-3e1c06f98bb7": {"text": "The bZIP transcription factor CrHY5 is predicted to be a prime target of LRS1 (Figure 3), strongly up-regulated in hit1 (Fig. 4b), required for proper light induction of photoprotection genes (Fig. 4c and d) and essential for constitutive LHCSR3 expression in the LRS1 mutant (Fig. 5d). Thus, we conclude that this transcription factor is a prime regulatory target of the CUL4-DDB1LRS1-SPA complex and dark-repressed via ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Fig 6a, Wt). The point mutation present in the WD40 domain of LRS1 in the hit1 mutant creates a loss of function by abolishing transcription factor binding (Fig. 6a, hit1), which could be confirmed by CRISPR-mediated removal of the WD40 domain region from LRS1, resulting in a hit1-like phenotype (Fig. 2b). As a consequence, the impaired function of the CUL4-DDB1LRS1-SPA E3 ligase permits an accumulation of CrHY5 and induction of photoprotection genes under dark conditions. Increased CrHY5 transcript amounts in hit1 under dark and light conditions (Fig. 4b) point at an autoregulation similar to the one described for Arabidopsis (Abbas et al., 2014; Binkert et al., 2014). We hypothesize that under excess light conditions the E3 ligase complex dissociates, thus relieving the repression of photoprotection gene expression (Fig. 6b). High light induction of photoprotection genes (Fig. 1b, c, d) and CrHY5 (Fig. 4b) is amplified in the hit1 mutant, since the existence of transcription factors preformed via constitutive expression should increase induction strength (Fig. 1b-d). This aspect of the phenotype together with the constitutive presence of LHCSR proteins protects hit1 from the photoinhibition caused in a wild-type by a sudden change of light intensity from low to very high light, as is tolerated by hit1 (Schierenbeck et al., 2015).", "figure_ref": ["fig3", "fig4", "fig4", "fig5", "fig6", "fig6", "fig2", "fig4", "fig6", "fig1", "fig4", "fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "e5fbcd23-64af-42b2-8657-7a4dd6058daf": {"text": "What is the light signal modulating the activity of the CUL4-DDB1LRS1-SPA complex? LRS1 has been shown to interact with UVR8 upon UV-B exposure (Tilbrook et al., 2016; Tokutsu et al., 2019) and in Arabidopsis this interaction is proposed to sequester the substrate adaptor COP1-SPA1 from the ubiquitin ligase complex, which stabilizes HY5 as a key transcription factor governing UV-B acclimation (Huang et al., 2013; Podolec and Ulm, 2018). Interestingly, as HY5 in A. thaliana, CrHY5 is strongly induced by UV-B light exposure of Chlamydomonas cells (Tilbrook et al., 2016) suggesting a conservation of this signaling mechanism between seed plant and green microalga and that CrHY5 might be vital for UV-B acclimation besides CONSTANS (Tokutsu et al., 2019), which is, however, not among the first-level interactors of LRS1 within the regulatory network (Supplemental Table 4). In contrast to LHCSR1 and PSBS, the accumulation of LHCSR3 is rather induced by excess light of longer wavelengths than UV-B radiation (Allorent et al., 2016) and phototropin-mediated blue light perception was shown to be critical for this regulation (Petroutsos et al., 2016).

In addition, the frequency of such extreme events are likely to increase as climate change worsens (Lesk, Rowhani & Ramankutty 2016). Therefore, plant drought tolerance is an important trait which we need to more completely understand at the physiological and molecular level (Godfray et al., 2010). Drought stress diminishes crop growth, disturbs plant water and plant nutrient relations, reduces photosynthesis and causes oxidative damage due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Salehi-Lisar & Bakhshayeshan-Agdam, 2016). Thus, plant drought tolerance is a complex process that mainly involves osmotic adjustment, osmoprotection, and antioxidative activity in the form of a ROS scavenging defense system (Farooq, Wahid, Kobayashi, Fujita & Basra, 2009). In addition, some chemical and physical stressors, that at high concentrations cause toxicity, may at low or moderate concentrations play a positive role by pre-conditioning plants against the negative influence of other abiotic factors, such as drought (V\u00e1zquez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2019). Such pre-conditioning is often refered to as cross-tolerance.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "a7bfd25a-c3be-4912-9006-2444e28cdc4e": {"text": "The ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum is conventionally defined as UV-C (<280 nm), UV-B (280-315 nm) and UV-A (315-400 nm) (Bj\u00f6rn, 2015). Approximately 95% of UV radiation reaching the Earth is UV-A, whereas UV-C and UV-B radiation below 290 nm are absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere (NASA, 2018). UV-B, despite of being only a small proportion of the UV spectrum, has the potential of altering plant morphology and metabolism (Jenkins, 2009). Previous studies have reported that UV-B stress has negative effects on photosynthesis, plant growth and biomass accumulation (Jansen, Gaba & Greenberg 1998; Jordan, 2002; Frohnmeyer & Staiger, 2003; Albert, Mikkelsen, Ro-Poulsen, Arndal & Michelsen 2011). However, research of the last decades has shown that ambient levels of UV-B, perceived through the UV-B photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8), regulate photomorphogenesis and defense responses, including photorepair processes, antioxidant activities and UV-screening (Jenkins, 2009; Rizzini et al., 2011; Jansen & Bornman, 2012; Morales et al., 2013). In this sense, UV-B radiation has been suggested to act as a signal that can promote tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress conditions. The potential use of UV-B radiation to alleviate the effects of drought stress has been reported in different plant species such as silver birch (Robson, Hartikainen & Aphalo, 2015a), rice (Dhanya Thomas, Dinakar & Puthur, 2020) and wheat (Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2014). Plant responses to the combination of drought and UV-B depend on whether the treatments are simultaneous or sequential (Escobar-Bravo et al., 2019). The sensitivity of the plant species also determines whether the interaction between drought and UV-B is additive, synergistic or antagonistic (Bandurska & Cie\u015blak, 2013). Cross-tolerance to drought may be activated by defense-related molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA), which are produced as responses to UV-B (A.-H.-Mackerness, John, Jordan & Thomas, 2001; Bandurska & Cie\u015blak, 2013; Tossi, Lamattina, Jenkins & Cassia, 2014; Mannucci et al., 2020).

Among H2O2-triggered responses, cross-tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses is often observed (Hossain et al., 2015). Alleviation of drought using H2O2-controlled elicitation has been reported in cucumber (Sun, Wang, Liu & Peng, 2016), rice (Sohag et al., 2020) and soybean (Ishibashi et al,. 2011). Drought stress increases levels of ROS, such as H2O2 and singlet oxygen (O2), in chloroplast, peroxisome, and mitochondria, which in turn can lead to oxidative damage (Cruz De Carvalho, 2008). Despite this, priming with H2O2 can protect plants against damage by triggering antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and ascorbic acid peroxidase (APX), thus reducing accumulation of different ROS (Hossain et al., 2015). This means that oxidative damage may be effectively alleviated by the antioxidant machinery after activation through exogenous H2O2 application. Application of either UV-B in barley or H2O2 in cucumber provided drought protection (Bandurska, Niedziela & Chadzinikolau, 2013; Sun et al., 2016). However, in what way UV-B and H2O2 together can prime drought tolerance remains unknown.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "245e586c-cd35-420f-b312-031f6ffffe36": {"text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate cross-tolerance responses under moderate drought conditions in Nicotiana tabacum plants.

Coral reefs are characterized by a rich structural complexity as coral colonies grow in diverse shapes such as branch-like, hemispherical, encrusting or plate-like morphotypes (Kaandorp and K\u00fcbler, 2001). The structure of coral skeletons has been studied in detail from macroscopic colony scales down to the nanometer scale, where scanning electron microscopy, 3D laser scanning and x-ray microcomputed tomography have acquired high resolution structural information of coral skeletons (Meibom et al., 2008; Raz-Bahat et al., 2009; Stolarski, 2003), which has significantly advanced our understanding of coral structure and calcification (Tambutt\u00e9 et al., 2007).

Recently, digital holographic microscopy (DHM) was used for non-invasive imaging of mucus formation in cold-water corals (Zetsche et al., 2016). DHM is a novel, essentially lense-free phase imaging method based on recording the interference between visible light passing through the sample and a reference light beam, where the interference pattern of an imaged object is first stored as a digital hologram and then digitally processed with reconstruction algorithms (Zetsche et al., 2014 and references therein).

A key technique that has revolutionized e.g. dermatology and ophthalmology is optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Huang et al., 1991), that allows for non-invasive in vivo cross sectional characterization of tissues with micrometer resolution using NIR. OCT is often referred to as an optical analogue to ultrasound, which measures the echo time delay of sound waves travelling into materials, where they are backscattered according to certain frequencies that depend on the acoustic properties of different material components. Likewise, OCT measures characteristic patterns of directly elastically backscattered (low coherent ballistic and near ballistic) photons from different reflective layers in a sample, e.g., at refractive index mismatches between tissue compartments with different microstructural properties (Schmitt, 1999). In the present study, we explored the use of OCT for studying coral tissue microstructure and dynamics. We demonstrate that OCT can be used as a rapid, non-invasive coral imaging technique that can easily be implemented in experimental setups to gain high resolution tomographic data on coral skeleton and tissue structure, and we present novel OCT-based approaches for the in vivo characterization of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like chromatophore system, tissue movement and surface area in living corals.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "e3a0a839-4248-42f2-a8ca-9a8ccd7b1110": {"text": "We used a commercially available spectral-domain (SD) OCT system (Ganymede II, Thorlabs GmbH, Luebeck, Germany) equipped with an objective lens with an effective focal length of 36 mm, and a working distance of 25.1 mm (LSM03; Thorlabs GmBh, Luebeck, Germany; Fig. 1a).

The sample beam penetrates the object along the z-axis, while the reference light is reflected by a retro-reflecting mirror within the imaging probe generating a reference beam of known path length.

In time-domain OCT, the reference mirror is rapidly scanned along the z-axis in order to vary the optical path length and thus imaging a particular depth of interest.

The good visibility of mesenterial filaments is likely related to their high lipid content (Brown et al., 1995) creating a sufficiently strong refractive index mismatch with the surrounding medium to result in excellent contrast and visualization through OCT (Fig. 3H).", "figure_ref": ["fig3", "fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "e9db9bce-a2e3-4220-9633-bd6a9528456e": {"text": "Coral mucus is fundamental to the energetics of coral reefs and mucus can comprise up to 20-45% of the energetic demands of corals (Wild et al., 2004). Mucus excretion is affected by e.g. temperature and light stress, bacterial infection, particle sedimentation and coral exposure to air (Brown and Bythell, 2005; Philipp and Fabricius, 2003). There has been substantial interest in imaging and quantifying coral mucus, but visualization has been hampered as it is almost invisible in conventional light microscopy, and mucus quantification has thus mainly relied on volumetric bulk measurements (Koren and Rosenberg, 2006; Wild et al., 2005). Mucus is essentially a hydrated gel (Brown and Bythell, 2005) and quantification via histology suffers from artefacts during sample preparation due to dehydration and subsequent shrinkage (Jatkar et al., 2010). Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) was recently used for visualizing the in vivo mucus secretion in cold-water corals (Zetsche et al., 2016) and this novel technique seems well suited for similar studies on symbiont-bearing corals. Here we show that OCT is a suitable alternative to DHM as it was able to resolve the string and sheath-like mucus structures adhering to the coral surface (Fig. 3J-K, Fig. S2). By exposing the coral Acropora aspera to air for about 30 seconds, we were able to stimulate excessive mucus production. Due to the rapid imaging acquisition of OCT, mucus excretion and transport can now be quantified and followed in real time (Fig. S2 and Movie 2).

In vivo visualization of GFP-like host pigment granules has been achieved by confocal microscopy using their natural fluorescence to create image contrast (Salih et al., 2000).

Photomicrographs of thin histological sections shown in Schlichter et al. (1994) revealed the presence of chromatophores roughly about 60 \u03bcm in diameter. Likewise, confocal microscopy stacks showed the presence of chromatophores within the same size category (~50-100 \u03bcm) (Salih et al., 2000; Salih et al., 2004).

Symbiodinium light exposure will also be affected by changes in tissue contraction and expansion (Wangpraseurt et al., 2014). Changes in tissue surface structure are thus likely to affect tissue surface and subsurface scattering as well as the optical path length between coral tissue surface and Symbiodinium. OCT provides a method to quantify such dynamic changes in surface structure and tissue density. Surface area is thus an important metric in coral biology research, where metabolic rates and e.g. Symbiodinium cell numbers are often normalized to coral surface area. Coral surface area has mainly been estimated from coral skeleton architecture through e.g. wax dipping and foil wrapping techniques (Marsh, 1970; Stimson and Kinzie, 1991) or x-ray scanning based computer tomography (\u03bcCT; Naumann et al., 2009). Direct surface area quantification on intact corals used has also been attempted with photogrammetry (Courtney et al., 2007; Holmes, 2008; Naumann et al., 2009), but these techniques have been established for surface area characterization on centimeter and meter scales, largely neglecting the micro-architectural complexity and plasticity of coral tissue surfaces (Fig. 2).

We calculated the change in three dimensional tissue surface area of the coral Pocillopora damicornis upon tissue contraction (Fig. 8) as the ratio of the three dimensional surface area normalized to the two dimensional projected surface area. Our calculations showed an approximate doubling (2.14 times) of relative tissue surface area upon tissue expansion from 2.2 (contracted) to 4.5 times (expanded) in the coral Pocillopora damicornis.

Translated into units we can oversee, the absorption of a single green 500-nm photon by a 35-kDa protein compares to the traceless swallowing of a 4-g, 9-mm Parabellum bullet, fired from a shotgun at the speed of sound, by a 35-g slab of soft biological matter. This apocalyptic event, taking place in myriads at every twinkle of the eye, forms the basis of oxygenic photosynthesis for the benefit of Life on the Planet. And it is also the task of the 35-kDa Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) in cyanobacterial photoprotection, which utilizes the extraordinary capability of its carotenoid cofactor to convert electronic excitation energy by internal conversion within a few picoseconds into harmless heat in order to shield the sensitive photosystems from excessive excitation energy arriving at the phycobilisome (PBs) antennae complexes at high light intensities (1-9). OCP is a blue-green light photoreceptor capable of undergoing a red shift of its absorption spectrum upon illumination (10, 11). Photoactivity necessarily requires a single 4-ketolated carotenoid molecule to be coordinated by OCP, which is 3\u2019-hydroxyechinenone when purified from cyanobacteria (3, 12), but also incorporation of echinenone (4-keto; ECN) and the 4,4\u2019-diketolated canthaxanthin (CAN) preserves photoactivity, whereas binding of the 3,3\u2019-dihydroxylated zeaxanthin precludes spectral switching (13-15). OCP is divided into two domains of about half its molecular weight, with an all-\u03b1-helical N-terminal domain (NTD) and a mixed \u03b1/\u03b2-type C-terminal domain (CTD) bearing similarity to the protein family of nuclear transfer factors (NTF-2, Pfam: PF02136), which almost symmetrically enclose a central carotenoid-binding cavity that nearly completely shields the cofactor from the aqueous environment (16, 17). The orange state OCPO is structurally stabilized by distinct carotenoid-protein interactions including specific H-bonds from Trp-288 and Tyr-201 in the CTD to the 4-keto oxygen at one of the \u03b2-rings, as well as interactions to Tyr-44 and \u03c0-stacking with Trp-110 in the NTD, but also extensive protein-protein interactions involving multiple H-bonds across the extensive NTD-CTD inter-domain interface (including two formed between Asn-104 and Trp-277, and Arg-155 and Glu-244 (18)) and binding of the \u03b1A-helix of the L-shaped N-terminal extension (NTE) to the central \u03b2-sheet surface on the CTD (19-22).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "261a2415-ea1a-46b0-b94a-bbfafb042246": {"text": "Upon photoconversion from the orange OCPO state, the red-shifted OCPR state is formed, which can interact with phycobilisome antennae complexes and quenches their fluorescence in the photoprotective mechanism of non-photochemical quenching (7, 21, 23, 24). According to biochemical (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC) and structural (small-angle X-ray scattering, SAXS, or static and dynamic X-ray crystallography) studies, the active, quenching OCPR state is characterized by increased disorder in terms of a molten globule, detachment and unfolding of the \u03b1A-helix from the CTD, domain separation and, eventually, a carotenoid translocation by 12-\u00c5 into the NTD, thereby forming a spectral state indistinguishable from the one of the Red Carotenoid Protein (RCP). The latter is a hydrolysis product of OCP comprising only the carotenoid-bound N-terminal domain, which constitutively quenches PBs fluorescence (25-28). The photoprotective mechanism in Synechocystis is terminated by the action of the Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP), which promotes dissociation of OCPR from the PBs and accelerates recovery to the OCPO state (29-31). Binding of FRP occurs to the CTD, most likely at a site covered in OCPO by the \u03b1A-helix, although some secondary, as yet unidentified, site might necessarily exist on the NTD or the interdomain linker as well to enable reversion of domain separation and back-sliding of the carotenoid cofactor into its initial position (22, 32). Spectral and structural changes of the protein and the carotenoid upon photoexcitation have been studied by multiple spectroscopic approaches (14, 28, 33, 34); however, main spectral and structural intermediates within the OCP photocycle (if existent) are still elusive, as is the case for the atomic structure of the most important, biologically active OCPR state.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "8ad4ca95-eaf1-40b4-ba1a-deb38a21057a": {"text": "The photocycle of OCP was previously studied with a time resolution of up to 100 ms by many scientific groups including ours. Such experiments are usually used for determining the rate of the OCPR to OCPO transition, which is often considered as the rate of protein refolding. Femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy has been used to probe the initial events following photoexcitation and excited state dynamics covering the time scale up to nanoseconds, which have revealed short-lived far-red-shifted absorption spectra, which have frequently been discussed as bearing similarities to internal charge transfer (ICT) states (2, 34, 35). The ultra-fast (fs) transitions between the excited states of the OCP chromophore were studied for several OCP species revealing that in both, orange and red, states the ECN cofactor has a very short (~ 6 ps) excited state lifetimes indicating that both states are potentially suitable for dissipation of excitation energy of PBs, thus, the conformation of the protein matrix, but not the spectral state of its chromophore, are crucial for PBs fluorescence quenching (2, 35). Additionally, substitution of the Arg-155 to Leu suppresses the induction of fluorescence quenching without the loss of photoactivity (18) from the one side, and constitutively quenching forms like RCP and the OCP-W288A mutant (17, 21) indicate that photoconversion and quenching are discrete events, suggesting that the protein state determines its functionality, while the color of the sample is only a side effect. As the rates of protein motions are significantly slower than the fs transients, the physiologically relevant OCP state capable of PBs fluorescence quenching should appear when the carotenoid is already back in the ground state, while between 100 ms and 1 s, there is already a decay of the red state due to back-relaxation and refolding of the protein.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "67adc6ef-ad12-40d2-894c-dfc135947392": {"text": "Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations have hinted at the configurational changes of the carotenoid that give rise to spectral shifts, and at the influence of the protein matrix on color tuning (11, 15, 33). Photoconversion is apparently accompanied by a reduction of the ring rotation angles at the C6-C7(C6\u2019-C7\u2019) single bonds of the carotenoid, which leads to an increase of the apparent conjugation length of the polyene chain, and to a relief of bending tension of the latter. As outlined by the recent study of Bandara and colleagues (36), this strained chromophore configuration in the dark-adapted state distinguishes OCP from other photoreceptors, in which strained chromophores are the initial or intermediate photoproducts on the way to the product state. Bending of the chromophore in OCPO most likely is due to the off-axis H-bond interaction of the 4-keto oxygen to the indole N-H group of Trp-288 in the CTD, while the carotenoid is otherwise tightly packed by a cavity constriction at the inter-domain interface and mainly hydrophobic and \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-110 in the NTD. Dynamic X-ray crystallography has identified very early structural intermediates of photoconversion showing detachment of the \u03b1A-helix, initial rigid-body separation of the CTD and retraction of Tyr-201 and Trp-288 from the terminal \u03b2-ring, indicating that breaking of the specific chromophore-protein H-bonds is one of the initial triggers of photoconversion (36). At the other end of the time scale, in the range of hundreds of milliseconds to hundreds of seconds, spectroscopic monitoring of light-induced absorption or fluorescence changes has revealed the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the global phototransformations between OCPO and OCPR (11), as well as the influence of amino acid substitutions, or the action of FRP on these processes (20-22). However, there is still a large gap of time scales to be covered by time-resolved absorption and other spectroscopic techniques in order to elucidate processes occurring between hundreds of nanoseconds to milliseconds for resolving the intermediate states of OCP, which appear during the photocycle. This previously omitted time window spans many orders of magnitude after photoexcitation, when the chromophore has for long returned to the electronic ground state, preceding the dramatic conformational changes of the protein, which occur upon its activation and relaxation.

If the yield would be higher, OCP photoconversion leading to PBs quenching may occur already unter potentially harmless conditions, thus diminishing the efficiency of light harvesting.

Addition of FRP slightly increased the rate of C1 to (220 \u03bcs)-1, the C2 component vanished, and the rate of C3 was significantly increased up to ~ (95 ms)-1. Importantly, the increase of the rates in the presence of FRP enabled us to reduce the integration time to solve the principal problem of such time-resolved experiments requiring the accumulation of hundreds and thousands of kinetics traces, i.e., several days of continuous measurements. Addition of FRP also made it possible to accurately measure the temperature dependency ( and ) of these rates and to estimate the corresponding activation energies, which appeared to be almost identical for the C1 and C3 components (~ 22 kcal/mol, see ). The similarity of the activation energies indicates that the huge differences in the rates of C1 and C3 are due to the pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius law, which reflects the probability of product formation in each of the elementary steps. Thus, the fastest C1 and the slowest C3 components reflect two different states with red shifted absorption spectrum, for which relaxation to the orange state is characterized by different numbers of attempts (or \u201ccollisions\u201d in collision theory) necessary to restore spectral characteristics of OCPO. One may assume that this is due to the protein conformation of OCP at different stages of photoconversion: protein conformation of the fast-decaying red intermediate (further OCPRI) is probably very similar to that of OCPO (small number of attempts to get to initial OCPO), while the slow decay is a feature of the commonly recognized OCPR with separated structural domains (very high number of attempts to get OCPO). Assuming that domain separation and 12-\u00c5 carotenoid translocation into the NTD correctly describe the physiologically active OCPR state, as inferred from crystal structures (26) and resonance energy transfer measurements (28), the slow component reflects the fact that the carotenoid needs to penetrate into the CTD again in order to recover its orange absorption spectrum.

We found that phosphate significantly reduces the amplitude of flash-induced spectral changes at 550 nm, accelerating the slow \u04213 component () and simultaneously reducing its yield (). This observation indicates that high concentrations of phosphate likely hinder domain separation of OCP, which is manifested in the rate of its back-conversion, and, therefore, accumulation of the physiologically active OCPR state, which explains why in vitro PBs quenching occurs only at a huge excess of OCP (~ 40 \u2013 100 OCP per 1 PBs (16, 21, 23, 24)).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "ae18822d-a827-40ac-a6a9-61d565a8d2ae": {"text": "At the same time, addition of phosphate does not affect the C1 component rate, thus confirming that the corresponding short-lived OCPRI intermediate, in terms of protein structure, still resembles the compact and stable OCPO, and its formation does not require significant conformational rearrangements and occurs before them. In contrast to the effect of phosphate, the rate of C1 is slightly increased by addition of FRP. This effect is relatively small (~ 10 %) compared to the influence of FRP on the C3 component ( indicating that FRP interacts effectively with the physiologically relevant OCPR state, but interactions with the OCPO-like OCPRI state are also possible. This conclusion is in agreement with our previous results about the OCP interaction with FRP (21). Next, deletion of the OCPO stabilizing N-terminal extension (NTE), which was recently suggested to also cover the FRP binding site on the CTD of OCPO, results in formation of stable FRP-OCP complex even in the dark (22). In such complexes, the rate of the fast C1 component is at least four times faster compared to full-length OCP and three times faster compared to full-length OCP in presence of FRP (). Thus, FRP increases the probability of orange form restoration not only from the physiologically active OCPR state, but also from the intermediate red OCPRI state. These facts might indicate that in the intermediate OCPRI, the \u03b1A helix of the NTE could already detach from the CTD uncovering the FRP binding site (22). A possible explanation of this phenomenon could be slow detachment of FRP from OCP, which occurs slower than the changes of carotenoid absorption on the timescale exceeding intervals between the excitation laser pulses in our experiment \u2013 1 s, or due to FRP binding to OCP in the orange state, which we observed at high concentrations (21, 32).

Kinetics of back-relaxation of this state to OCPO was previously studied in detail, but from the perspective of the chromophore absorption spectrum only. Previously, we showed that the OCP photocycle can be studied by different fluorescence techniques (14, 28, 41), including the monitoring of Trp fluorescence (11). Thus, we decided to follow the intrinsic fluorescence of OCP and compare the kinetics of carotenoid- and protein-related transients.

Namely, (i) changes of absorption at 550 nm and (ii) Trp fluorescence emission at 350 nm were studied. Fluorescence was detected by time-correlated single photon counting, which allowed us to assess not only the changes of fluorescence intensity, but also the lifetime(s) of Trp fluorescence.

This fact indicates that restoration of the initial EET efficiency between Trp residues and the carotenoid, as characteristic for the dark adapted OCPO state, occurs only after the protein-carotenoid system is already in its orange form. On the other hand, the comparison of the changes of fluorescence lifetimes and intensities allows discriminating between dynamic (EET-related) and static quenching (). Our data show that restoration of static quenching (e.g. due to H-bond formation or other interactions of Trp residues) precedes the changes in carotenoid-protein absorption. We postulate that formation of this distinct orange intermediate (further termed OCPOI) state precedes the final structural rearrangements and restoration of protein-chromophore interactions, which are necessary for stabilization of CTD-NTD interactions and formation of the initial OCPO state. Considering the fact that restoration of the orange absorption spectrum of the carotenoid requires its correct positioning between CTD and NTD of OCP including the formation of H-bonds and eventually also the characteristically bent structure of the polyene chain, we assume that relocation of carotenoid from NTD to CTD is a primary step on the way to the dark adapted stable OCPO. As discussed earlier, the rate of OCPR-OCPO back-conversion depends on multiple factors; however, the re-establishment of the critical H-bonds between the keto oxygen in the \u03b21-ring of ECN and Trp-288 and Tyr-201 must be crucial for stabilization of OCPOI intermediate state and following formation of OCPO.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "d5f1bf87-5bbd-4641-8d95-2ca50038f584": {"text": "Previously, we characterized the purple W288A mutant of OCP, which appeared to be functionally similar to the physiologically active OCPR state in terms of capability of PBs fluorescence quenching and interaction with FRP (14, 21). Upon addition of FRP to OCPW288A we observed complex formation with 1 to 1 stoichiometry, and the absorption spectrum of this complex exhibited characteristic signatures of the orange state (referred to as \u201coranging\u201d), presumably, due to OCPW288A stabilization by FRP (21). We hypothesized whether the FRP-induced stabilization of OCPW288A can be mimicked by kosmotropic phosphate anion, which acts non-specifically (19, 24, 40, 42), resulting in stabilization of CTD-NTD interactions (see  and description in text). Increasing the phosphate concentration in OCPW288A solutions (pH was kept constant) caused a gradual increase of absorption in the blue spectral region and the appearance of vibronic substructure, a characteristic signature of the orange OCP form. Surprisingly, at 0.8 M phosphate, the spectrum of OCP-W288A barely retained features of its initial (phosphate-free) state (red-purple, with maximum at 520 nm (14, 21)) and could fairly well be modeled by a sum of two OCP forms (): an orange OCPO spectrum (~75%) and a violet spectrum with maximum absorption at 550 nm (25 %). Recently, we have demonstrated that the latter violet forms of OCP may appear upon carotenoid (canthaxanthin, CAN) transfer into Apo-OCP (43) and represent dimers of OCP, in which a symmetric CAN molecule with keto-oxygens at both \u03b2-rings is symmetrically positioned between two CTDs, as e.g. in the dimeric COCP characterized earlier (15). Such dimers may be additionally stabilized by cross-protein interactions of NTEs and CTDs (36). Formation of such violet forms requires intermediates, in which the carotenoid is positioned in the CTD. Therefore, translocation of the carotenoid from the NTD must occur. We assume that only CAN-coordinating species could be stabilized between two CTDs due to the required symmetry of keto/H-bond interactions. These facts strongly indicate that positioning of the carotenoid in OCPR is not static, and it can move or slide until specific H-bonds with Trp-288 and Tyr-201 are restored, probably, after multiple trials. Due to the absence of the H-bond donor Trp-288, the OCPOI state of the OCPW288A mutant is less stable, but this dynamic equilibrium between OCPOI and OCPR could be shifted towards the orange form by FRP or phosphate, and most likely kosmotropes in general. In the presence of such stabilizing agents, one H-bond with Tyr-201 is sufficient to preserve OCP in the orange-like state. However, neither FRP nor phosphate affect the absorption spectrum of OCPY201A/W288A mutant, which is similar to such of OCPW288A, indicating that in both mutants the carotenoids are not connected to the CTD. It cannot be concluded that the structure of such a phosphate-induced orange-like OCPW288A is identical to OCPO, but surprisingly, phosphate does not only restore several of its spectral characteristics, but also the ability to photoconvert under actinic light (). This fact is also supported by Raman spectra (), which simultaneously exhibit typical features of violet and red OCP forms, but not of the orange state, because it is inevitably photoactivated by 532-nm laser used for Raman spectroscopy. Amazingly, the amplitude of photoconversion in this special case is not reduced by the high phosphate concentration (). Rather, the rates of the red to orange back-conversion were inversely proportional to the phosphate concentration (). These facts demonstrate that Trp-288 is not necessary for the photoswitching of OCP itself, but rather is important for the stabilization of the OCPOI intermediate during back-conversion, or for formation of the final compact OCPO state with its distinct carotenoid curvature as recently suggested by Bandara et al.

This issue cannot be directly solved by mutagenesis due to the significance of Trp residues (in particular, Trp-288, \u2212110 and \u221241) for functional activity of OCP (18, 19). It is known that excited-state electron transfer to protein backbone carbonyls is the most important mechanism of Trp fluorescence quenching (44). Considering this fact and the tight interactions between Trp-288 and the keto oxygen of the \u03b2-ring of ECN, we assume that the fluorescence of Trp-288 could be statically quenched (see above). In our previous work, we have demonstrated that two CTDs of OCP can bind CAN (with keto oxygens at each \u03b2-ring) and that Trp-288 plays an important role in stabilization of this homodimeric COCP (15) (43). Comparison of the Trp fluorescence decay kinetics of COCP and its apoprotein form (Apo-COCP), both having only two tryptophans (Trp-277 and Trp-288 in the CTD of Synechocystis OCP) reveals that the fluorescence of both Trp residues is significantly quenched by about 85% in the presence of the carotenoid (). Trp fluorescence quenching in COCP is of mixed type, with about 25 % dynamic (attributable to the change in average lifetime) and the other about 60 % due to static quenching, which means that in the carotenoid-coordinating homodimer of CTDs, two Trps are statically quenched and the other two contribute to excitation energy transfer (EET) to the carotenoid. We assume that Trp-288 is statically quenched due to H-bonding with the carotenoid and Trp-277 is quenched due to EET. The situation for Trp-277 in COCP might well be different from the one in the OCPO state, because in the latter, Trp-277 could be involved in static quenching, since it forms an H-bond to Asn-104 according to the crystal structure (18), but there is no evidence yet for a similar H-bond in the COCP dimer of CTDs.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "27821bad-47fc-4ec8-9111-6ee0f054c1f0": {"text": "For further assignment of the mechanism of Trp fluorescence quenching in OCP, we studied Trp fluorescence in the presence of different concentrations of iodide, a well-known and commonly used collisional (dynamic) quencher.

We found that iodide differently affected the fluorescence decay of OCP in its orange and red forms ( and D).

Essentially coinciding curves with smaller slopes (Stern-Volmer constants of about 3.5 M-1) were determined for Apo-OCP and OCPR (see ). However, the Stern-Volmer plot of OCPO showed only very limited quenching by iodide with saturating behavior at low iodide concentrations (). This observation suggests a substantially limited accessibility of Trp residues in OCPO, which invoked the necessity to evaluate the data according to the modified Stern-Volmer plot (F0/(F0-F) versus 1/[I-], see (45)), as depicted in , to determine the fraction of accessible Trp residues (f) in OCPO. For OCPO, the analysis of the modified Stern-Volmer plots yielded a f value of about 0.33 (). It is important to recall that in the compact OCPO state, three out of five Trp residues are already involved in static quenching due to interactions with the carotenoid (see text above), leaving only two Trp residues contributing to the observed fluorescence amplitude. Only one of these two Trp residues is apparently accessible to collisional quenching by iodide, whereas the other is involved in EET to the carotenoid but without quencher access. Considering the structure of OCPO (PDB entry: 3MG1), the residue accessible to iodide quenching should be Trp-277, which we assume to be involved in EET to the carotenoid together with Trp-101, which is the furthest from the carotenoid, while the Trp residues in the carotenoid-coordinating cavity, Trp-288, Trp-41 and Trp-110, are involved in interactions with the carotenoid leading to the effect of static quenching.

This approach allowed us to determine for the first time two novel intermediate states of the OCP photocycle, which can clearly be identified by distinct spectroscopic features, in addition to the stable orange OCPO and the physiologically active red OCPR (). We found that accumulation of the red intermediate state OCPRI, which is identical to OCPR in terms of its absorption spectrum, occurs faster than 200 ns. We assume that the extremely fast photoisomerization of the carotenoid disrupts hydrogen bonds between the keto oxygen at the \u03b2-ring of ECN (or CAN) and Trp-288/Tyr-201 in the CTD of OCP, which affects the absorption of carotenoid and leads to the first spectral intermediate. Features of Trp fluorescence of this state need to be studied in more detail, but most probably it is already characterized by increased fluorescence intensity due to at least partial elimination of static quenching. The OCPRI state is probably characterized by a protein conformation similar to the dark-adapted OCPO, and thus is able to rapidly convert into the orange state by \u201cclamping\u201d the chromophore. Conversion into the red OCPRI form is associated with a (fast) relaxation of the initially bent carotenoid, which, acting just as a spring, may push the protein towards conformational rearrangements including detachment of the \u03b1A helix of NTE (36). This reduces the stability of the CTD-NTD protein-protein interactions and leads to separation of domains. Considering the results of dynamic X-ray scattering and atomic structures of OCPO and RCP (26, 36, 46), we may assume that the NTE is acting like a conductor of the signal from the CTD into the NTD, which may trigger small but important rearrangements in the NTD, including the 6\u00b0 rotation of the \u03b1-helix containing Trp-41, and thus facilitating the translocation of carotenoid. In terms of kinetics, the red OCPR state with separated domains is much more stable compared to the intermediate OCPRI, since the geometry of OCPR reduces the probability that the carotenoid reaches the CTD again at least 10 000-fold (compare time constants for the OCPRI-OCPO (300 \u03bcs) and the OCPR-OCPO transition (3.3 s)).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "9b3b03c8-014e-4d60-9bcf-def9976aab0c": {"text": "Together with the observed kinetic properties of dynamic and static quenching upon back-conversion of OCPR to OCPO (), the determination of Trp residues involved in different types of quenching provide novel insights into carotenoid\u2013protein interactions in the intermediate states. Considering the differences in the rates, we postulate that restoration of the initial orange state OCPO occurs in several steps. First of all, the carotenoid restores its position in the NTD, which probably requires a translocation comparable to 12 \u00c5 (26). This step does not necessarily affect absorption of the carotenoid-protein system; however, it results in restoration of static quenching of Trp-41 and Trp-110 (), and is most probably reversible. We assume that the formation of violet states () is indicative of significant mobility of the carotenoid in the NTD, which can shift by about 12 \u00c5 to its position like in the RCP crystal structure (PDB: 4XB4), but it also can slide in the opposite direction. The second step occurs only if NTD and CTD are properly oriented against each other (likely to be assisted by FRP), so that the carotenoid may reach Tyr-201 and Trp-288 in correct configuration, resulting in the formation of the intermediate state OCPOI, which is characterized by orange-shifted absorption and static quenching of three Trp residues. This state can be reached without the assistance of Trp-288 (see ), however the latter determines the stability of this intermediate. The next and final step towards OCPO requires adjustments of protein structure which result in restoration of initial efficiency of EET from Trp-277 and Trp-101 to the carotenoid (), and most likely also involve the final bending of the carotenoid into its strained configuration as seen in the OCPO crystal structure. These final atomic-scale adjustments of the protein structure probably affect some spectral characteristics of the carotenoid including Raman bands responsible for out-of-plane distortions of the polyene chain due to final compaction of the protein.

Conversion into the orange intermediate OCPOI state is initiated by carotenoid translocation towards the CTD, which probably requires restoration of carotenoid \u03b2-ring position and hydrophobic interactions with Trp-41 and Trp-110, simultaneously quenching their fluorescence (). Conversion to the orange absorption spectrum is possible due to restoration of the hydrogen bond to Tyr-201 and can be externally stabilized by FRP or high phosphate concentrations, although natural stabilization of carotenoid in this state requires additional bonding with Trp-288. Stabilization of the OCPOI state induces conformational changes of the protein structure, which follows the changes in absorption spectrum at a slower rate, resulting in the pronounced asynchrony of the photoactivation-induced changes in OCP (). Thus, it is important to discriminate between spectral characteristics and functional (physiological) properties of different OCP states, the changes of which may occur asynchronously. Considering the well-established facts that the carotenoid is an excellent quencher of excitation energy in both red and orange state, and the importance of the OCP conformation for interactions with other proteins, one can hypothesize that OCPOI state is still capable of PBs fluorescence quenching and interaction with FRP, while in terms of its spectrum, this state already largely resembles the initial orange state. We also predict that some OCP mutants, which could be trapped in the orange state, may bind to the phycobilisomes and, probably, even induce quenching.

The immediately appearing red intermediate OCPRI (state 2) is unstable and may rapidly (K ~ 300 \u03bcs-1, see ) return in to the initial orange state, as the protein structure of this red intermediate is similar to OCPO. However, carotenoid isomerization induces significant changes of the protein structure, which result in a significantly lower rate of red to orange transition, due to separation of structural domains in OCPR (stage 3). This relatively long-lived red state is physiologically active and can induce quenching of PBs fluorescence. Continuous illumination by actinic light causes accumulation of OCPR. However, even under continuous actinic illumination, dissipation of the red form occurs due to the following steps, which include carotenoid translocation into the CTD. This process occurs spontaneously most likely due to a high mobility of carotenoid in its hydrophobic cavity. In the wild-type OCP, this translocation may result in the reestablishment of hydrophobic interactions between one \u03b2-ring of the carotenoid and Trp-41 and Trp-101 in the NTD.

The highest average 1-qL value observed during these fluctuations was 0.56, suggesting that 44% of acceptors are still in an oxidized state during rapid 0-2,000 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121 light transitions. Using a brief period of far-red light after illumination the dark measured qL (qLd) average was 0.97, which infers that only 3% of PSII reaction centers are permanently damaged and required a newly synthesized D1 protein. During these realistic solar noon light fluctuations, NPQ was not significantly employed as a mode of excess energy dissipation, and measured values only reached a maximum of ~0.2 (Fig 6B).

Here we show D. armatus changes chl a/b ratio throughout a 24 hr light period, like Chlamydomonas, but has significantly higher a/b ratios.

For comparison, Chlamydomonas grown under similar HL and LL static light and sinusoidal light conditions had chl a/b ratios of 2.76-3.49 (Cantrell and Peers, 2017), and engineered truncated light harvesting antennae protein mutants have chl a/b ratios of ~8.1 (Polle ). It is worthwhile noting the unusual adaptation response in pigment ratio and quantity of D. armatus during its exponential growth phase. Chl b is almost exclusively located in the light harvesting antennae, thus high chl a/b ratios indicate small antennae.

Many studies testing NPQ capacities utilize a low light to high light shift, or P-I measurements, which do not occur in mass culture conditions (Andersson ). Jallet  illustrated that a high ex situ NPQ capacity, does not mean a large in situ NPQ, even when grown under simulated natural light regimes. We wanted to test whether in situ conditions here were also insufficient to activate NPQ, or whether NPQ is absent as a major photoprotective mechanism in this species. The P-I experiments illustrated that intense light conditions were not enough to reduce all primary electron carriers in HL and SL-acclimated cultures (measured as 1-qL, Fig 3B). This was correlated with a limited NPQ capacity of <0.4 (Fig 3A). For comparison, SL-grown P. tricornutum form the same amount of NPQ at 620 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121, as D. armatus cells do at 4,000 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121 (Jallet ).

A large amount of light dependent oxygen consumption significantly reduced the net oxygen production capacity of cells adapted to all light conditions (Fig 4). Furthermore, as is common with photosynthetic organisms, parameters derived to measure photosynthetic efficiency and maximum productivity (Fig 5) reflect acclimation history. The \u03b1 parameter shows differences between all groups (RM-ANOVA, p=0.042), but differences between HL and LL adapted cells were not significant (Tukey\u2019s test, p=0.084) as in other organisms (Ware ; Cantrell and Peers, 2017). \u03b1 is predominantly influenced by the functional antennae of supercomplexes, but LL conditions do not induce large antennae in D. armatus during exponential growth phase. Despite the lack of significant acclimation-related changes in \u03b1, Pmax and IK parameters change significantly (Fig 5). Thus, it likely reflects differences in electron transport and carbon fixation processes that arise independently of antennae protein accumulation.

Andersson  illustrated that cells spend only ~25% of the day in the linear response range (<Phalf-max), and the remainder in either light limiting or excess light conditions, which significantly reduces photosynthetic efficiency compared to growth in the integrated average light intensity. Growth of photosynthetic algae in industrially relevant conditions have suggested that AET plays a more prominent role than NPQ in balancing the overreduction of PSII (Jallet ; Andersson ). Testing of NPQ capacity ex situ was required to rule it out as a major photoprotective process in this organism, but it might have suggested an exaggerated role for AET in situ. Thus, we utilized the light environment previously used by Andersson  to assay the utilization of AET vs NPQ in industrially relevant, in situ light conditions (ZT 6 h; Fig S5). These assays showed that extreme light fluctuations do not cause an overreduction of QA and do not induce NPQ (Fig 6A and B). Instead, up to 90% of electrons generated by the splitting of water can be consumed by oxygen consuming reactions downstream of PSII (Fig 6C), and they do not contribute to carbon fixation. Additionally, there is only minor photoinhibition in approximately 3% of RCII (qLd = 0.97). This result suggests that AET engineering could improve photosynthetic efficiency at an industrial scale. Indeed, expression of FLV proteins in tobacco and Arabidopsis, and overexpression of FLV proteins in Synechocystis sp.

Lincomycin infiltration is a useful tool as it allows for the separation of photoprotective processes in maintaining a functional PSII, from recovery processes that restore the damaged chloroplast-encoded D1 protein. We observed a decline in Fv/Fm and a ~90% reduction in D1 protein within 2 hours of light exposure in lincomycin treated cells (Figure 8). We estimated that the half-life of the D1 protein in D. armatus is 42 min. This is significantly more rapid than has been observed for diatoms (Key ). D1 protein turnover in spinach illustrated a 30-120 min half-life and the rate was dependent on light acclimation history (Aro ; Tyystj\u00e4rvi ).

It could also be due to an increase in transcriptional activity of the protease responsible for D1 protein degradation in high light (Hihara et al., 2001), or an accumulation of FtsH proteases (Ni ).

The first two characteristics are desirable for commercial production of algae, with reduction of antennae proteins reflecting a prominent target for bioengineering in order to increase photosynthetic efficiency (Polle ; Melis, 2009). It was therefore encouraging to observe these properties in an organism already shown to have high productivities in mass culture. This work also adds support to our recent studies on Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 (Andersson ) and Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Jallet ) which suggest that NPQ is minimally employed by cells in light conditions that simulate mass culture, and that AET should be a focus of future algal bioengineering targets to increase photosynthetic productivity.

The radiative energy balance in such phototrophic microbial communities is affected by the incident radiative energy from the sun, of which a fraction is backscattered and thus not absorbed, while absorbed light energy is either photochemically conserved via photosynthesis or dissipated as heat via radiative energy transfer and non-photochemical quenching (Al-Najjar ; Brodersen ).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "045ebf43-e630-42f8-aefe-9faf55ebaf76": {"text": "The quantity and quality of light are key regulating factors of photosynthesis, and the microscale distribution of light in microphytobenthic systems has been studied intensively over the last decades (J\u00f8rgensen and Des Marais, 1988; Lassen ; K\u00fchl and J\u00f8rgensen, 1994; K\u00fchl, 2005). A sub-saturating flux of photons will limit the rate of photosynthesis, as the available light is insufficient to support the maximal potential rate of the light reactions but as the photon flux increases the photosynthetic system saturates, whereby O2 becomes a competitive inhibitor on the binding-site of CO2 to Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) (Falkowski and Raven, 2007). In addition, when light energy absorption exceeds the capacity for light utilization, excess energy is channelled into heat production via non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) processes to avoid degradation of pigments and other cell constituents e.g. by reactive singlet oxygen produced by the de-excitation of triplet state chlorophyll (3Chl*) (M\u00fcller ).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "b8e2df92-5696-4d87-b1ce-0e924d277086": {"text": "Photosynthetic organisms deploy different mechanisms to avoid photo damage, where NPQ is an effective short-term way to dispose of excess energy (M\u00fcller ).

In sediments, incident light will be spread by multiple scattering and, while the light field will become totally diffuse with depth (K\u00fchl and J\u00f8rgensen, 1994), the response of benthic photosynthetic organisms to incident diffuse light is unknown. Through evaporation, an increase in cloud cover has been predicted with global warming (Schiermeier, 2006), which will potentially change the direction of light from relatively collimated beams (~85% in clear-sky conditions) to a more isotropic diffuse light field (~100% in cloud covered conditions)(Bird and Riordan, 1986; Brodersen ; Gorton ). In addition, submerged benthic systems will experience temporal and spatial differences in light field isotropy depending on turbidity, water depth, sun angle and the reflective properties of the surrounding environment (Brakel, 1979; Kirk, 1994; Wangpraseurt and K\u00fchl, 2014).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "727a909d-b9a9-4b3c-bd49-7c0d8b7658d6": {"text": "Increased rates of photosynthesis have been observed in forest communities with an increasing proportion of diffuse light, possibly due to a more even distribution of light in the canopy (Gu ; Krakauer and Randerson, 2003; Misson ; Urban ), whereby light energy is more efficiently harvested from all directions deeper in the canopy. This effect changes at the single leaf scale, where a 2-3% lower absorptance has been found under diffuse light as compared to collimated light at equivalent incident irradiances (Brodersen and Vogelmann, 2007). In corals, it has been observed that gross photosynthesis increased ~2-fold under collimated compared to diffuse light of identical downwelling irradiance (Wangpraseurt and K\u00fchl, 2014) and the directional quality of light may thus elicit different photosynthetic responses and could potentially change the photosynthetic efficiency. A factor contributing to a possible difference in photosynthetic activity under diffuse and collimated light is photoinhibition, that initiates when the photosystems are saturated and the electron transport chain is fully reduced (Murata ). Under high collimated light conditions, chloroplasts in leaves move to periclinal walls, and this might lead to reduced photoinhibition due to shading of other chloroplasts (Gorton ). Under diffuse light, chloroplast movement to the periclinal walls is not complete (Williams ) thus more randomly distributed, leading to possible less effective self-shading and photoprotection (Brodersen ).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "d096155d-634a-4355-8035-fdaf161f9538": {"text": "The balance between photosynthesis and respiration and as such, light use efficiency in benthic phototrophic systems is also influenced by the thickness of the diffusive and thermal boundary layers (J\u00f8rgensen and Des Marais, 1990; Jimenez ; Brodersen ).

Dissipation of absorbed solar radiation as heat drives an increase in surface temperature that is counter-balanced by heat transfer to the surrounding water via a thermal boundary layer (TBL), where convection dominates the transport of heat and the surface warming increases linearly with the incident irradiance (Jimenez ).

Apparently, diffuse light was absorbed more efficiently in the uppermost layers, increasing the local photon density and residence time in these layers resulting in increased energy deposition and surface temperatures. This was supported by a higher heat flux into the water column under diffuse light, and a higher heat flux into the sediment under collimated light (data not shown). At increasing irradiances the surface temperature of the sediments exceeded the surrounding water temperature and convective heat transport occurred over the TBL (Fig. 5) (Jimenez ). While we cannot dissect the observed heat dissipation into particular mechanisms and their relative magnitude, part of such dissipation in optically dense biofilms and sediments involves non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) processes that protect the photosynthetic apparatus under high irradiance by channelling excess light energy into heat dissipation (Falkowski and Raven, 2007; Al-Najjar ). The heat fluxes from the photic zone were generally higher in the biofilm when compared to the coral sediment, due to the lower reflection and thus higher absorption in the biofilm Fig. S4). However, when normalizing the heat fluxes to the absorbed light energy (which was 33% higher in the biofilm than in the coral sediment) the heat dissipation was of similar magnitude, and variations in heat flux values between the sediment and biofilm became <15%.

The photosynthetic activity in the coral sediment was stratified at incident irradiances >50 \u00b5mol photons m\u22122 s\u22121 under both diffuse and collimated light (Fig. 4). This stratification could be a result of different factors influencing the photosynthetic activity such as steep light attenuation over depth, locally high volume-specific rates of metabolic activity, higher local biomass of phototrophs and diffusion limitation of metabolic products and substrates (K\u00fchl ; K\u00fchl and Fenchel, 2000; Al-Najjar ). Such vertical stratification has also been associated with phototactic responses to light (Whale and Walsby, 1984; Lassen ), where motile photosynthetic organisms migrate to an optimal depth for photosynthesis at a given irradiance, where the available light is neither limiting nor inhibiting the rate of photosynthesis (Al-Najjar ). These migration patterns are well documented both as photo-and aero-tactic responses and to escape from e.g. toxic levels of sulphide (K\u00fchl ; Bebout and Garcia-Pichel, 1995).

Consequently, the coral sediment reached an asymptotic maximum in PG in terms of energy dissipation via photosynthesis of ~4.2 J m\u22122 s\u22121 as compared to only ~0.9 J m\u22122 s\u22121 in the biofilm (Fig. 6). The Ek value, i.e., the irradiance at the onset of photosynthesis saturation, was >2 higher in the coral sediment compared to the Danish biofilm, which reflects the different in situ light conditions experienced by the two systems in their respective geographic locations (Denmark: 55\u00b0N, Heron Island: 23\u00b0S). Thus, the dense biofilm appeared acclimated to low irradiances as previously shown (K\u00fchl ; K\u00fchl and Fenchel, 2000; Al-Najjar ) where highly reduced quantum efficiencies are seen at increasing irradiance due to the employment of e.g. NPQ processes. Accordingly, the coral sediment maintained higher photosynthetic efficiencies, even at high irradiance. This could in part be explained by the high scattering in the sediment particles that creates a more even spread of the light field over the sediment matrix and a more dispersed photic zone; a factor that have been speculated to be responsible for the high photosynthesis in coral tissues (Brodersen ; Wangpraseurt ). A more homogenous distribution of light would create a larger region where light is neither limiting nor inhibiting photosynthesis.

In spite of this difference in overall acclimation to light, a decrease in the surface layer photosynthesis was seen in the coral sediment at an incident irradiance of 500 \u00b5mol photons m\u22122 s\u22121, which could either reflect the heterogeneity and patchiness of the phototrophs found in the sediment, or could point to a possible migration of motile phototrophic organisms. Migration as a phototactic response is recognized as an effective mechanism for regulating photon absorption across different systems such as terrestrial plants (Wada ) and microphytobenthic assemblages (Serodio ; Cartaxana ; Cartaxana ), and similar phototactic response have been shown in coral tissues where the in hospite light environment can be modulated by host tissue movement (Wangpraseurt ; Wangpraseurt ). Downward migration at high irradiances is probably correlated with increasing photic stress e.g. by the formation of reactive oxygen species that can affect photosystem II by damaging (or preventing the repair of) the D1 protein in these layers (Hihara ; Nishiyama ; Aarti ; Latifi ; Al-Najjar ). Several ways to counter such photic stress exists. One of the most effective short-term responses to photic stress is to employ non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in which photons are emitted as heat when cells experience over-saturating photon fluxes. Another strategy to avoid photodamage is to upregulate the expression of sun-protective pigments such as \u03b2-carotenes (Zhu ), which were found in significant amounts by HPLC analysis of the coral sediment (Fig. S1).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "05f0ccc7-ed03-4ae5-ab04-a141b781bd79": {"text": "Photosynthetic energy conservation was higher under collimated light as compared to illumination with diffuse light at moderate irradiance (200 \u00b5mol photons m\u22122 s\u22121) (Fig. 6).

In terrestrial leaves, the more efficient utilization of collimated light has been ascribed to specialized tissue structures such as columnar palisade cells (Vogelmann and Martin, 1993), that increase the absorptance of direct light over diffuse light (Brodersen and Vogelmann, 2007). Furthermore, light-induced chloroplast movement has been shown to be less effective under diffuse illumination (Gorton ; Williams ). In corals the higher photosynthesis at the tissue surface was explained by optical properties enhancing the scalar irradiance near the surface under direct illumination (Wangpraseurt and K\u00fchl, 2014). This tendency changed dramatically in the dense photosynthetic biofilm at light-limiting conditions (\u2a7d100 \u00b5mol photons m\u22122 s\u22121) favouring effective light utilization under diffuse light (Fig. 7).

The key to phototransformation is the light absorption by a single keto-carotenoid chromophore (in OCPs from native sources 3\u2019-hydroxyechinenone, hECN) that triggers significant rearrangements of the 35 kDa protein matrix (Wilson et al, 2008). The quantum yield of this process is about 0.2 % (Maksimov et al, 2015; Maksimov et al, 2017c) that is sufficient for keeping OCP in its inactive orange form under low to moderate insolation levels suitable for photosynthesis. The stability of the orange form is determined by multiple protein-chromophore interactions and structural features of the protein matrix. The structural characteristics of OCP are dominated by two structurally distinct N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD, respectively) in addition to: (i) a flexible interdomain linker; (ii) an N-terminal extension (NTE) that interacts with a specific site in the C-terminal domain; (iii) numerous contacts between the domains in the carotenoid-binding cavity (Bandara et al, 2017; Liu et al, 2014; Sluchanko et al, 2017c; Thurotte et al, 2015; Wilson et al, 2012; Wilson et al, 2011); and (iv) two distinct H-bonds between a Trp and a Tyr residue in the CTD and the keto-oxygen of the chromophore.

In agreement with Fig. 4F, the \u0394NTE+ AmaxFRP profile contained a peak of the complex and also a small shoulder presumably corresponding to the FRP excess. Supporting the value determined from column calibration (42 kDa), the MW distribution across the main peak revealed the mean value of 46 kDa exactly coinciding with the equimolar protein ratio (calculated monomer MW are 12.6 kDa for AmaxFRP and 33.4 kDa for \u0394NTE), in line with the previous in vitro observations suggesting 1:1 apparent stoichiometry for various OCP-FRP complexes (Moldenhauer et al, 2017b; Sluchanko et al, 2017a; Sluchanko et al, 2017c). When a 3.5-fold excess of SynFRP was mixed with \u0394NTE, we observed two peaks with the mean MW of 59 and 28 kDa, corresponding to the heterocomplex and the excessive FRP. Surprisingly, the amplitude of the remaining FRP peak was consistent with the notion that more than one FRP equivalent moved to the peak of the heterocomplex, in accord with its MW = 59 kDa, implying 1:2 apparent OCP:FRP stoichiometry (Fig. 5). The average RH values determined from the light scattering for the complexes with 1:2 and 1:1 apparent stoichiometries were also significantly different (3.82 and 3.32 nm, respectively). These completely unexpected results indicate that, depending on conditions, FRP can form not only 1:1 but also 1:2 complexes with \u0394NTE. In the light of this finding, the intermediary MW values of the \u0394NTE complexes with SynFRP (50.6 kDa) and AnaFRP (50.5 kDa) observed in Fig. 4D,E most likely reflect a mixture of 1:1 and 1:2 complexes and, therefore, may indicate that the connection between FRP monomers weakens in the heterocomplexes, as would be characteristic for the transitory state between FRP dimer binding to OCP and ultimate formation of the 1:1 complex between OCP and FRP. By analogy, the smaller size of the OCPAA/ AmaxFRP complexes (Fig. 4I) may indicate the same difference in stoichiometry as seen in the case of \u0394NTE.

In line with our previous observations, SynFRP was unable to bind to the OCP-NTD (also termed RCP) in either its apo- (Fig. 6A; apparent MW \u2013 21.7 kDa) or holoform (Fig. S3), but showed interaction with the carotenoprotein COCP (apparent MW \u2013 43.8 kDa; heterocomplexes \u2013 51.7 kDa) corresponding to the dimer of two CTDs of Synechocystis OCP containing a single carotenoid (Moldenhauer et al, 2017a), implying that the main FRP binding site should be located on the OCP-CTD. This interaction with COCP is independent of the presence of carotenoid (Moldenhauer et al, 2017a). A similar preference towards COCP was demonstrated by AnaFRP, which also did not interact with the RCP apoprotein (Fig. 6B). Neither did AmaxFRP (Fig. 6C); however, in its case we could barely detect interaction even with COCP (Fig. 6F), in contrast to SynFRP (Fig. 6D) and AnaFRP (Fig. 6E). Therefore, AmaxFRP, which under the conditions used readily interacts with full-length OCP variants by forming exclusively 1:1 complexes (Fig. 4F, I), is virtually incapable of binding individual CTDs in the form of the COCP dimer. These observations may mean that the FRP-binding site on the OCP-CTD is just one part of the (multisite) FRP-binding region in OCP, since all tested FRP species including AmaxFRP showed interactions with OCP forms containing two domains (either separated or not). This observation is consistent with the previously postulated hypothesis that FRP works as a scaffold bringing the OCP domains together (Lu et al, 2017; Sluchanko et al, 2017a; Sluchanko et al, 2017c). Different FRP binding modes with OCP seems also probable, especially given the recently proposed hypothesis that FRP has two activities in relation to OCP, i.e., it accelerates the OCPR\u2192OCPO transition and it detaches OCP from PBs (Thurotte et al, 2017). Taking into account the co-occurrence of a full-length OCP and individual CTD homologues in some cyanobacteria, the possibility of interaction between FRPs and CTDHs warrants separate detailed investigation.", "figure_ref": ["fig6", "fig6", "fig6", "fig6", "fig6", "fig6", "fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "9b6f1c71-61ef-4011-b3a9-df27f18f7de8": {"text": "As it was noted, FRP may have two distinct roles: (1) it can increase the rate of the OCPR\u2192OCPO transition and (2) it can detach OCP from PBs (Thurotte et al, 2017). In order to compare these functional properties of different FRPs, we tested both functions in vitro. It should be noted that spectroscopic monitoring of interactions between OCP, FRP and PBs captures a mixture of multiple simultaneously occurring processes, including diffusion- (and concentration)- dependent binding of FRP to free OCP, binding of FRP to the OCP-PBs complexes, spontaneous or FRP-induced OCPR\u2192OCPO conversion, and spontaneous or FRP-induced detachment of OCP from PBs (Shirshin et al, 2017). Considering the complexity of these reactions, we sought for experimental settings to isolate specific stages. As reported previously, the accumulation of the active quenching OCP form can be represented by the following set of transitions: OCPO(orange compact, inactive) \u2192 OCPRI(red compact, inactive) \u2192 OCPR(red, separated domains, functionally active), with asynchronous changes in the carotenoid and protein components (Maksimov et al, 2017c). Taking this into account, by using \u0394NTE we analyzed the effect of FRP within the preformed OCP-FRP complexes on the lifetime of the red state (OCPR) with separated domains. Then, using the OCPAA double mutant, which is constantly active in the dark and cannot be inactivated by phosphate (Maksimov et al, 2017c) (Fig. S4), we studied the rates of the FRP-induced detachment of OCP from PBs. Finally, we tested if \u0394NTE in the red state (equivalent to OCPR) can induce PBs fluorescence quenching upon continuous illumination of the sample by actinic light (AL) in the presence of various FRPs.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "5c173bb0-81e8-4578-b042-598a50ce8ef5": {"text": "Fig. 7A shows that all studied FRPs significantly decrease the lifetime of the red active state of \u2206NTE comparing to the case when FRP is absent (~ 3300 ms; see Table S3). Surprisingly, SynFRP did not show the best efficiency of accelerating the decay of the red state of its cognate OCP. Rather, AnaFRP accelerated the decay of OCPRI almost two times (~ (50 \u03bcs)-1) compared to the values in the presence of SynFRP or AmaxFRP (~ (90\u2013100 \u03bcs)\u22121). While this indirectly indicates that the \u0394NTE/ AnaFRP complex provides a strong interaction and the best environment for the restoration of H-bonds between the carotenoid and Tyr-201/Trp-288, the faster decay of the OCPRI intermediate coincides with a reduced quantum yield for full photoconversion into the OCPR state (~ 84 %) as indicated by the lower intermediate plateau between 1 and 10 ms. Nevertheless, AnaFRP was also characterized by the slowest OCPR\u2192OCPO back conversion compared to SynFRP indicating a compromised ability to reverse the domain separation. These observations suggest that the ability of FRP to serve as a scaffold for the correct NTD-CTD alignment represents a property which is separate from the stabilizing interactions required for re-establishing the proper chromophore-protein interactions. Considering the observed lifetimes of OCPR and assuming OCPRI\u2192OCPO as an elementary act, one can estimate that \u0394NTE/ AnaFRP needs about 3300 attempts to connect the domains, which is much higher comparing to complexes with SynFRP (~ 1550 attempts) and especially AmaxFRP (~ 990 attempts). As long as the absence of NTE ensures binding of FRPs to the main site in the CTD, such estimations may indicate that different FRPs have different efficiency of interactions with the secondary FRP binding site(s) tentatively located on the NTD, in the framework of the proposed \u2018domain-bridging\u2019 FRP activity (Lu et al, 2017; Sluchanko et al, 2017a; Sluchanko et al, 2017c).", "figure_ref": ["fig7"], "table_ref": []}, "0cfc42fc-beb3-40bc-8a4d-fe7846dbf6ac": {"text": "Influence of different FRP species on the OCP photoactivity and the ability to induce PBs fluorescence quenching in vitro.

It should also be noted that due to the absence of the H-bond donors to the ketocarotenoid in the CTD of OCPAA, even the proper positioning of OCP domains assisted by FRP cannot cause formation of the orange form, thus the FRP-induced detachment of OCP from PBs occurs regardless of the spectral characteristics of the OCP state (red vs. orange), supporting the existence of several independent functional activities of FRP.

Upon binding to OCPR with separated domains, FRP accelerates its back conversion to OCPO, dramatically decreasing the OCPR lifetime. This makes potentially informative structural studies very challenging and, therefore, the whole process of the FRP-regulated OCP functioning on a molecular level so poorly understood. In this respect, detailed investigation of more kinetically stable intermediates of the OCP photocycle, OCP mutants and individual domains, in complex with FRP seems much more promising. By now, the strongest FRP binders not requiring photoactivation are the purple mutant OCP forms (Maksimov et al, 2017c; Sluchanko et al, 2017a) having key Trp/Tyr residues participating in the H-bonding to carotenoid mutated (apparent KD ~2-3 \u03bcM, i.e. at least 10 times stronger than for OCPO (Sluchanko et al, 2017a)) and the \u0394NTE form with non-separated domains (apparent KD <1 \u03bcM (Sluchanko et al, 2017c)); the binding is also observed with COCP composed of CTD dimers, but not with RCP or RCPapo (=NTD) (Moldenhauer et al, 2017a; Sluchanko et al, 2017b; Sutter et al, 2013), implying the presence of the main FRP binding site on the OCP-CTD. It was also hypothesized that FRP can act as a scaffold bridging the two OCP domains together (Lu et al, 2017; Sluchanko et al, 2017a) and can have an extended, multisite binding region on OCP (Yang et al, 2015), which is supported by observation of intermediary NTD-FRP-CTD complexes by native mass-spectrometry (Lu et al, 2017) and compaction of the OCP forms with separated domains upon FRP binding (Moldenhauer et al, 2017b; Sluchanko et al, 2017a). Phe-299 (Thurotte et al, 2017) and other hydrophobic residues on the OCP-CTD, covered by NTE in OCPO (Sluchanko et al, 2017c), were proposed to be important for FRP recruitment and action on OCP. Intriguingly, FRP binding can be accompanied by its monomerization, which earlier led to a suggestion about the role of the subunit interface in the interaction process (Sluchanko et al, 2017a; Sluchanko et al, 2017c). Conformational changes involving the unfolding of the head FRP domain were hypothesized to play a critical role in the FRP mechanism (Lu et al, 2017), whereby FRP can serve as a lever arm or jack bringing the domains close to each other. The proposed conformational changes seem very reasonable and may somehow destabilize the subunit interface within the OCP-bound FRP, explaining its monomerization. Nevertheless, the whole series of interconversions, as well as stoichiometries and structures of intermediary complexes formed during the OCP photocycle in the presence of FRP are not clearly elucidated.

In particular, it is the final electron acceptor in the aerobic respiratory electron transport chain in bacteria and in the mitochondrial inner membrane of animals and plants. However, O2 can be converted into toxic molecules like reactive oxygen species (ROS), including the superoxide anion radical (O2\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH), and singlet oxygen (1O2) (Foyer and Noctor 2020). In mitochondria, O2\u2212 is produced in complexes I and III of the electron transport chain (Noctor et al. 2007). In plants\u2019 thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, photosystem II and I (PSII and PSI) are another hot spot for generation of ROS (Krieger-Liszkay 2005; Schmitt et al. 2014; Dietz et al. 2016). During photosynthesis, O2\u2212 is mostly generated at the PSI when the light energy is strong and excessively overcomes the demand for photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (Inoue et al. 1989; Kozuleva et al. 2020; Roach et al. 2015). Once generated, ROS rapidly and irreversibly cause the inactivation of PSI (Sonoike 2011).

Originally, photosynthetic FLV have been identified in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S6803) as a homologous protein to an A-type flavoprotein from anaerobic bacteria, in which the protein family is termed as FDP (Vicente et al. 2002; Helman et al. 2003). The FDP family is defined based on two functional domains: a diiron center and a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binding motif that presumably serves the reduction of O2 directly to H2O using various electron donors (Rom\u00e3o et al. 2016a). In contrast to FDP in anaerobic bacteria, the FLV in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms harbors an additional unique domain that has homology with a flavin:NAD(P)H oxidoreductase (FlR) (Vicente et al. 2002). The detailed reaction mechanism of FLV is still unclear. Many mutant studies have shown that FLV are a major contributor to the electron transport from the acceptor side of PSI to O2 (Helman et al. 2003; Yamamoto et al. 2016; Chaux et al. 2017), which can contribute to P700 oxidation (Allahverdiyeva et al. 2013; Shimakawa et al. 2016; Helman et al. 2003). Recently, in cyanobacteria, FLV were found to reduce O2 by using electrons from reduced ferredoxin (or iron-sulfur clusters) in vivo (S\u00e9tif et al. 2020).

Originally, bacterial FDP are known to function in the form of a head-to-tail homodimer or tetramer because the catalytic site of the diiron center is closer to that of the FMN binding site in the protein on the other side (~ 6 \u00c5) than in that within the same monomer (~ 40 \u00c5)(Rom\u00e3o et al. 2016a).

In this work, we have shown that the FLV gene sequences of Symbiodiniaceae are atypically composed of two classical FLV sequences tandemly repeated (Fig. 1). The upstream and downstream regions show strong similarity to the two photosynthetic FLV groups i.e., FLVA and FLVB (Fig. 4). From the evolutionary relationship among FLVA and FLVB isozymes in photosynthetic organisms (Fig. 5), it is highly likely that the different types of FLVA and FLVB genes have been fused in Symbiodiniaceae to result in the hybrid FLV gene after the primary FLV gene duplication common to all photosynthetic organisms. We have further shown that the FLV protein was probably cleaved into both FLVA and FLVB after translation, making it one of the rare examples of polycistronic eukaryotic gene. We have shown that the Symbiodiniaceae Cladocopium sp. has a strong capacity for O2 photoreduction comparable to CO2 assimilation (Roberty et al. 2014) during the first minutes of onset of light, which is similar to the FLV activity in cyanobacteria and green algae (Helman et al. 2003; Burlacot et al. 2018; Chaux et al. 2017; Allahverdiyeva et al. 2013). This important O2-photoreduction could be attributed to various mechanisms among such as photorespiration, FLV-mediated O2 photoreduction, the Mehler reaction, plastid terminal oxidase activity, and mitochondrial respiration (Curien et al. 2016). Although the lack of available genetic engineering techniques in Cladocopium sp. limits a dissection of the contribution of these mechanisms, the O2-dependent electron transport shown in this work is typical for the FLV-mediated O2 photoreduction measured in cyanobacteria, green algae, and basal land plants (Helman et al. 2003; Burlacot et al. 2018; Chaux et al. 2017; Santana-Sanchez et al. 2019; Shimakawa et al. 2017a). Further, Cladocopium sp. rapidly induced P700 oxidation in response to the illumination with actinic light, in an O2-dependent manner (Fig. 3), which is a typical physiological response observed in photosynthetic organisms harboring FLV (Shimakawa et al. 2019; Takagi et al. 2017; Il\u00edk et al. 2017).

In addition, the disruption of any FLV gene has a strong effect on O2 photoreduction in many environmental conditions (Chaux et al. 2017; Allahverdiyeva et al. 2011; Santana-Sanchez et al. 2019). However, the functioning of FLV as a hetero or homodimer remains blurry in most photosynthetic organisms, and the dissection of each hypothesis remains difficult. Here we have shown an atypical gene fusion of FLVA and FLVB in Cladocopium sp. that has an O2 photoreduction potential (Fig. 2 and 3). Gene fusion events are the result of strong selective pressure (Enright et al. 1999), thus making it clear that in the coral symbiont, both FLVA and FLVB are required for O2 photoreduction, at least, at the transcript level. Immunoblotting was likely to detect the fusion protein but also the individual proteins of FLVA and FLVB in Cladocopium sp. (Fig. 6), which suggests that the hybrid protein is cleaved by a post-translational mechanism. In the cyanobacterium S6803, the FLV3 homodimer does not function in O2 photo-reduction but in stress acclimation (Mustila et al. 2016). The fusion protein may be cleaved to form the homodimer in the Symbiodiniaceae Cladocopium sp. In photosynthetic eukaryotes like green microalgae, when transcriptomic data are available, the FLVB gene is much more expressed than the FLVA gene (Kleessen et al. 2015; Fang et al. 2012), which has long suggested a different role for each proteins formed (Mustila et al. 2016). In addition, transcriptomic data have found different expression patterns for both FLVA and FLVB genes (Fang et al. 2012; Tulin and Cross 2015), but the role of such differential regulation remains to be explored.

However, our data clearly suggests that the presence of both proteins is crucial for FLV activity, we therefore propose that such in vitro activity of a homodimer is probably much lower than the one mediated by a heterodimer. The recently discovered NO-reduction mechanism of FLV (Burlacot et al. 2020) may be a new way to assess recombinant FLV activity with a more specific reaction. Recently, it has been implied that FLVA can be targeted by thioredoxin in Chlamydomonas (P\u00e9rez-P\u00e9rez et al. 2017), and actually several cysteine residues are conserved in both FLVA and FLVB sequences (Fig. 4).

That is, the Symbiodiniaceae FLV have evolved through the different evolutionary history from the green plastid lineage. The phylogenetic tree suggested that FLV in Symbiodiniaceae is highly likely to have been inherited from basal green algae (Fig. 5). One possibility is that the dinoflagellates obtained the genes for FLVA and FLVB in the polycistronic form in a lateral gene transfer event (Fig. 7).

However, modulation of metabolism and protein function can contribute to this process by impacting signaling, organelle interactions and cell fate decisions towards apoptosis, senescence or malignant transformation (de Gruijl et al., 2001; El Ghissassi et al., 2009). Importantly, besides impacting cell fate decisions, UV-induced changes in cellular physiology can alter differentiation and stem cell division, accelerating the growth of mutant cell clones in the skin.

In this work we confirmed that UVA exposure caused a nucleocytoplasmic dynamic event induced by DNA damage. For instance, our algorithms detected with high confidence the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of CSNK2B in UVA-irradiated cells, a finding further confirmed by confocal microscopy. CSNK2 has many biological targets, maintaining cellular viability and participating in the DNA damage response (Gray et al., 2014; Montenarh, 2016; Yefi et al., 2011). Its role in the cellular response against UVR has been described in terms of its interaction with p53 and NER components as well as by its role in cell cycle arrest (Montenarh, 2016). Indeed, using the comet assay, we observed that UVA radiation leads to simultaneous CPD formation and CSNK2B translocation, as expected. We also monitored DNA damage over time and observed that CPDs are repaired over 24 hours, indicating NER activation.

In our experiment, we detected two types of dynamic events: redistributions of mitochondrial proteins over the subcellular space, which were detected by the TRANSPIRE and neural networks algorithms, as well as changes in mitochondrial dynamics, which were reflected as systematic changes in the fractionation profiles of mitochondrial markers. We showed that UVA induces mitochondrial fragmentation, up-regulates redox-responsive proteins and reduces the respiratory rate, leading to changes in the cells\u2019 overall energetic status. Mitochondrial fragmentation depends on the balance between fusion and fission, enabling adaptation to stress and different metabolic demands (Sprenger and Langer, 2019). If fragmentation of the interconnected mitochondrial network occurs transiently, it can facilitate mitophagy, for example, leading to adaptation to stress (Sprenger and Langer, 2019). For instance, mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy are essential for keratinocyte cornification, a physiological process (Simpson et al., 2021). On the other hand, chronic fragmentation may be associated to other types of cell death and tissue damage (Sprenger and Langer, 2019).

It has been suggested that UVA-induced deletions in mtDNA underlie the long-term effects of UVA during photoaging (Berneburg et al., 2004). However, our results suggest that UVA also has short-term effects on the mitochondria, acting as a potent stressor immediately after exposure. Some endogenous metabolites have been proposed to play a role in UVA\u2019s photosensitization in skin cells, such as flavin-derivatives, NADH, NADPH, FADH, urocanic acid, porphyrins and some sterols (Wondrak et al., 2006).

In lakes, long-term warming and seasonal increases in water temperature intensify the strength of stratification and promote oligotrophication of the offshore surface layer (Zohary et al., 2020). Generally, smaller phytoplankton cells have advantages in the upper layer of stratified water columns (Falkowski & Oliver, 2007; Winder et al., 2009; Zohary et al., 2020) because of a lower sinking velocity (Reynolds, 2006), rapid growth rate (Banse, 1976; Schlesinger et al., 1981; Finkel et al., 2010; Mei et al., 2011) and a relatively high nutrient uptake rate per cell volume (Suttle et al., 1987; Sunda & Hardison, 2010; Edwards et al., 2011).

Jin et al. (2013) pointed out that strengthened stratification can increase light intensity and reduce light fluctuation, which may influence photosynthetic activity and productivity of phytoplankton in upper mixed layers. Recent bio-optical studies suggest that species composed of relatively large cells may be less susceptible to excess light or fluctuation stress than those composed of smaller cells (Suggett et al., 2009; Alderkamp et al., 2010; Key et al., 2010). Species composed of large cells and those that form large aggregated colonies tend to have lower intracellular Chl-a concentrations (Ci) to avoid intracellular self-shading effects (i.e. the packaging effect, Duyens, 1956; Agust\u00ed, 1991; Finkel, 2001). Low Ci, leads to decreased light absorption cross sections and, subsequently, lower sensitivity to photosystem II (PSII) photoinactivation (Finkel et al., 2010; Key et al., 2010) due to excess light energy (Marshall et al., 2000). Photoinactivation not only reduces linear electron flow in PSII but also increases the energy required for PSII repair (Key et al., 2010; Campbell & Ser\u00f4dio, 2020). Thus, high light conditions can be particularly advantageous to large phytoplankton (Key et al., 2010).

In this study, the abundance of zygnematophytes, mainly S. dorsidentiferum and M. hardyi, decreased from July to September during the strong stratification period and increased in October and November in the mixing layer (Fig. 4, Appendix Fig. A1). At the end of the stratification period, the enhanced vertical mixing might increase light fluctuation (Jin et al., 2013) and decrease the sinking loss rate (Zohary et al., 2020). Consequently, the mean cell size of phytoplankton in the large size fractions increased by up to three-fold at station 12B from September to October due to seasonal blooms of large green algae (Fig. 3c).", "figure_ref": ["fig4", "fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "eab3bff2-ea77-435f-9b0e-0c2de9f8ca0e": {"text": "The results of the present study show for the first time that the sizes of phytoplankton cells in natural lake communities are dependent on F and NPQ. The F and F values of large phytoplankton are greater than those of small phytoplankton in marine communities (Moore et al., 2005; Suggett et al., 2009; Giannini & Ciotti, 2016). Key et al. (2010) demonstrated that the large marine diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii has less vulnerability to PSII photoinactivation and, thus, less suppression of F under excess light than the small marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. Previous studies have reported that large phytoplankton cells have a relatively low pigment concentration per cell volume (Agust\u00ed, 1991; \u00c1lvarez et al., 2016) and, thus, a small absorption cross section per PSII (Morel & Bricaud, 1981; Kirk, 1994; Suggett et al., 2009), which results in lower susceptibility to excess light stress and PSII photodamage. In contrast, small phytoplankton cells are more susceptible to excess light stress and PSII photodamage and, therefore, expend more energy for PSII repair (Key et al., 2010). In this study, the F values of the large size factions were always greater and the NPQ values were always lower than those of the small size fractions within the same community (Fig. 5). Moreover, the F ratio of the large size fractions remained greater and the NPQ value was lower as compared to those of the small size fractions under increased light (Fig. 6, 7). Actually, the F ratio and NPQ value were significantly correlated with Ci, (Fig. 8a, b), but not Vcell (Fig. 8c, d). These results indicate that variations in intracellular pigment concentrations may influence susceptibility to light stress rather than cell size (Agusti & Phlips, 1992; Suggett et al., 2009; Campbell & Ser\u00f4dio, 2020). Indeed, the susceptibility of small phytoplankton to excess light stress decreases with decreasing intracellular pigment concentration in an aggregated colony (Wu et al., 2011).", "figure_ref": ["fig5", "fig6", "fig7", "fig8", "fig8"], "table_ref": []}, "6950dd3b-742e-4142-b234-e5e89ffceae0": {"text": "The advantage of large phytoplankton was pronounced at the end of the stratification period at the pelagic stations in Lake Biwa, as the F ratio of the small size fractions had improved with N and P enrichment at the end of the stratification period in October and November, but not that of the large size fractions (Table 2). Similarly, the NPQ values of the small size fractions had decreased in October (Table 2). These results imply that nutrient limitation in PSII photochemistry is size-dependent in the pelagic site in autumn. This phenomenon can be explained by the fluctuation of light and PSII photodamage. At the end of the stratification period, enlargement of the mixing layer causes higher levels of light fluctuation within a water column, which can increase the chance of exposure to excess light for dark-acclimated cells, which induces PSII photodamage (Alderkamp et al., 2010; Helbling et al., 2013). The low-light acclimation reduced the F ratio and growth rate of algae under fluctuating light conditions due to lower ability to dissipate excess light energy (Yarnold et al., 2016). In autumn, the depth of the mixing layer in Lake Biwa was greater than that of the euphotic zone (Table 2, Fig. 2), thus the phytoplankton became more acclimated to low light or dark conditions. Indeed, the Ci, of the small size fractions at station 12B increased toward the end of the stratification period (Fig. 3d). These results imply that small phytoplankton tended to acclimate to low light or dark conditions in the enhanced mixing water column at the end of the stratification period and, thus, became sensitive to excess light stress and vulnerable to PSII photoinactivation. Moreover, the rate of PSII repair is influenced by temperature and nutrient availability (Nishiyama & Murata, 2014). Low-temperature stress inhibits D1 protein synthesis, D1 protein degradation in the photodamaged PSII and processing of the D1 preprotein, which generates the mature D1 protein (Nishiyama & Murata, 2014). Synthesis of the D1 protein and xanthophyll, which plays crucial roles in the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle, is also sensitive to nutrient deficiency (Larkum et al., 2003; Shelly et al., 2010). In addition to excess light stress, temperature and nutrient availability might play interactive roles in xanthophyll accumulation or PSII repair (Campbell & Ser\u00f4dio, 2020). Notably, the \u03bc[chl] of the small size fractions at station 12B did not change in October and November (Table 2), suggesting that small phytoplankton might increase PSII quantum yield without increasing antenna Chl-a in order to adapt to excess light. As compared with small phytoplankton, large phytoplankton were relatively less susceptible to PSII photodamage (Suggett et al., 2009; Key et al., 2010) and, thus, conditions were more favorable during the end of the stratification period in Lake Biwa.", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig3"], "table_ref": ["tbl2", "tbl2", "tbl2", "tbl2"]}, "3fd55f2f-1108-451a-ac74-b8236e4ac0c3": {"text": "The results of the \u03bc[chl] of both small and large phytoplankton suggest that the population growth rates are enhanced by N and P enrichment from July to September (Table 2). Also, the N and P uptake rates of the phytoplankton community at both the beginning and end of the incubation period had increased in August and September (Appendix Fig. 6). However, at station 12C, \u03bc[chl] was greater in the large phytoplankton than the small phytoplankton in response to N and P enrichment in August and September (Table 2). Possibly, cyanobacteria might be favored by N and P enrichment in the large size fractions, which were dominant in these months (Fig. 4d). At the end of the stratification period, N and P limitations to the population growth rate and photochemistry were mitigated, with the exception of small phytoplankton at station 12B (Table 2). In deep lakes and oceans, enhanced vertical mixing increases nutrient availability through transportation from deeper depths to the water surface (Falkowski & Oliver, 2007). Moreover, the autumn typhoon season provides particulate and dissolved nutrients to the lake surface by rainfalls and river discharge, which causes the phytoplankton biomass to rapidly increase (Robarts et al., 1998). An intermittent or fluctuating nutrient supply can favor large phytoplankton (Pinckney et al., 2001; Moore et al., 2008; Bullejos et al., 2010). In marine ecosystems, an intermittent nutrient supply can favor large diatoms due to the presence of relatively large nitrogen storage vacuoles (Litchman et al., 2009). Although many freshwater green algae have storage vacuoles (Tozzi et al., 2004; Becker, 2007; Shebanova et al., 2017), the N and P storage abilities have been confirmed in relatively few species (Shebanova et al., 2017), but not S. dorsidentiferum and M. hardyi yet.

However, the speed and the scale of changes in the size structure should also be considered. Indeed, Van de Waal and Litchman (2020) pointed out that the increasing light availability due to shrinking of the mixing layer can benefit large diatoms. In regard to river phytoplankton, increases in the frequency of sudden flood events will result in increased spring blooms of large phytoplankton (Abonyi et al., 2018). The grazing effects of crustacean zooplankton likely also play important roles (Lampert et al., 1986; Sunda & Hardison, 2010; Branco et al., 2020). Yvon-Durocher et al. (2015) revealed that enhanced zooplankton grazing due to global warming has increased the mean cell size of phytoplankton communities. Future studies should focus on whether light environments, mixing events and predation effects can mitigate the shrinking of phytoplankton cell size with the warming of lake waters. Because phytoplankton size structure is an important factor in the material cycle (Ray et al., 2001; Law et al., 2009) and trophic structure (Kazama et al., 2021b) in lakes, it is necessary to determine the response of local phytoplankton communities to global climate change in order to develop better conservation and management plans for aquatic ecosystems in the future.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}}, "10.1101/829036": {"1e364e7c-98bf-43e8-9a02-655d0cbcf88e": {"text": "Forest understories are dynamic and heterogeneous light environments.

Different plant species segregate into functional types with differing light-capture strategies within the forest understory plant community (Grubb 1977, Wolkovich and Cleland 2011, Heberling et al. 2019). Accordingly, species may adopt different strategies to time their growth and life cycle, adapting to seasonal variation in light availability in the forest understory (Augspurger et al. 2005, Heberling et al. 2019).

Spring ephemeral species time their emergence and leaf out in spring to maximize carbon gain then senesce during canopy closure when the irradiance drops in deciduous stands (Kudo et al. 2008). During autumn leaf senescence, the canopy opens, and once again more light is available to the forest understory (Richardson and O\u2019Keefe 2009). This autumn light niche in the understory is exploited by many perennial herbaceous species and tree seedlings which delay leaf senescence until during or after canopy opening, extending photosynthesis for overwinter carbon storage (Augspurger et al. 2005, Kudo et al. 2008). Wintergreen plants produce new leaves each year which overwinter then senesce during the growing season (Heberling et al. 2019). Although carbon gain is often negligible during winter, this strategy allows them to exploit favorable conditions for photosynthesis in early spring during snowmelt (Landh\u00e4usser et al. 1997, Saarinen et al. 2015). Shade-tolerant species in the understory may likewise have later leaf emergence, but extend their leaf longevity utilizing low light efficiently, whereas the leaves of more light-demanding species may emerge earlier to exploit relatively high understory irradiances before canopy closure (Niinemets, 2010).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "57bf9bef-e90f-46c3-968e-fbea70589583": {"text": "Once the canopy closes, the understory light environment is mostly shade (Chazdon and Pearcy, 1991).

Far-Red (FR) light is mostly reflected or transmitted from canopy leaf surfaces and scattered into the understory shade, reducing the ratio of red(R): FR light (Ballar\u00e9 and Pierik 2017). These changes in R:FR in the understory are detected by phytochrome photoreceptors, which coordinate the shade avoidance syndrome in many species (Ballar\u00e9 et al. 1987). Similarly, the irradiance of blue light and UV radiation penetrating into the forest understory is reduced during canopy leaf out, due to its absorption by the plant canopy (Casal 2012), although, in relative terms, the ratio of UV: photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is increased in understory shade due to the higher diffusivity of UV radiation (Flint and Caldwell 1998, Grant et al. 2005).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "6c6d0e40-f1bb-4437-9b7f-1c4aa96dc5fd": {"text": "Plants produce photo-protective pigments such as carotenoids and flavonoids in response to highlight stress and UV radiation (Agati and Tattini 2010, Agati et al. 2012, Brunetti et al. 2018).

The action spectra of these two photoreceptors may in fact overlap in the UV-A region (Morales et al. 2013, Brelsford et al. 2018). Rai et al. (2019) conjecture that responses, like flavonoid induction, primarily governed by CRY or UVR8 segregate at 350 nm wavelength. Flavonoids can be broadly separated into anthocyanins and flavonols/flavones (Agati et al. 2012); both classes function as antioxidants with epidermal flavonols also screening UV-radiation, although anthocyanins also absorb in the blue and to a lesser extent UV region of the spectrum (Steyn et al. 2002).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "5928ea24-c521-4b48-a265-b0111d4b2d17": {"text": "We know relatively little about how the role of flavonoids differs among plant functional types in response to light.

However, given that relatively few studies have been designed explicitly to compare flavonoid accumulation among different plant functional types, we lack the information needed to make these broad generalizations. There are several hypotheses identifying different environmental cues accounting for the seasonal dynamics of anthocyanins, including temperature, herbivory and light stress (Lee 2002, Hoch et al. 2003, Karageorgou and Manetas 2006, Archetti et al. 2009). For many plant species, anthocyanins increase in senescing leaves (Feild et al. 2001, Lee 2002), and shading can reduce the production of anthocyanins during autumn in woody species, as well as delaying leaf senescence, irrespective of the R:FR ratio (Lee et al. 2003). To date, it is still unknown what light signal, if any, is responsible for the reduction of autumnal anthocyanins and delayed leaf senescence under shaded conditions. Interestingly, supplementary UV radiation from lamps has been shown to accelerate leaf senescence in Fagus sylvatica, possibly through increased photodamage throughout the growing season (Zeuthen et al. 1997). As such, the reduction of UV radiation under canopy shade could affect leaf senescence in understorey plant species.

However, the effect of blue light we report is consistent with findings from an experiment using branches of B. pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Q. robur under controlled conditions where PAR was equalised across filter treatments (Brelsford and Robson, 2018). Our study is also in line with a recent meta-analysis, in finding that UV radiation has a negligible effect on bud burst (Brelsford et al. 2019). Unlike A. platanoides, the emergence and leaf out of none of our herbaceous species responded to light quality in the understory. This confirms our hypothesis that leaf out in herbaceous species would be less responsive than tree seedlings to changes in light quality during spring. This result reaffirms the suggestion that the main cues controlling spring emergence in herbaceous species, which are submerged belowground during winter, are probably the timing of snow melt and increase in soil temperature rather than light quality (Price and Waser 1998, Rice et al. 2018).

Blue light has been shown to enhance photosynthesis beyond simply its contribution to PAR, particularly in allowing the utilisation of transient sunflecks through rapid stomatal opening and rubisco activation (S\u00e6b\u00f8 et al. 1995, Goins et al. 1997; Matsuda et al. 2004; Ko\u0161vancov\u00e1-Zitov\u00e1 et al. 2009, Hogewoning et al. 2010). Attenuation of blue light throughout the growing season could reduce photosynthesis by impeding this rapid induction response, meaning that prolonged leaf retention is required to compensate for reduced carbon gain over the growing season (Chabot and Hicks, 1982, Zhang et al. 2013). As attenuating blue light from solar radiation also reduces PAR (by an average of 34.4 % in no blue no UV filter compared to control filter in our case), the delayed leaf senescence in response to attenuation of blue light that we report could be due to the reduction in PAR (Lee et al. 2003). This could also explain why attenuating blue light delayed leaf senescence the most in A. platanoides seedlings growing in the evergreen stand, where PAR was also lowest (Table S4, Fig. 3). However, neither our measurements of photosynthetic capacity nor stomatal conductance significantly differed across our filter treatments in A. platanoides, as might otherwise be expected in response to PAR or blue light (Fig. S8, Fig. S9). There is some evidence from research into other plant species, such as Glycine max, that the blue-light-detecting photoreceptors, cryptochromes, fulfill a specific role involving blue light in the acceleration of leaf senescence (Meng et al. 2013).", "figure_ref": ["fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "73fc4c65-9383-4558-a3a1-fe2b095ff1ee": {"text": "In contrast to A. platanoides, there was no effect of our filter treatments on the leaf senescence of Q. robur seedlings.

Q. robur may reabsorb less nutrients from its leaves compared to tree seedlings of similar species in the autumn (Hagen-Thorn et al. 2006). This suggestion is consistent with the peak of leaf chlorophyll content found during autumn canopy opening in Q. robur (Fig. S9). Furthermore, the photosynthetic capacity of Q. robur trees is slow to develop throughout the season (Morecroft et al. 2003) and could indicate that Q. robur has a different strategy involving extended carbon assimilation further into autumn compared to other species in our study.", "figure_ref": ["fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "cdac5585-c44f-44e9-940b-b645a9e5eb0a": {"text": "As well as the effect of blue light, attenuating UV radiation below 350nm also delayed the onset of leaf senescence in A. platanoides (4.1 days delay for UV radiation below 350nm, and 14.3 days delay for blue light).

However, past research has found that supplemental UV-B radiation can accelerate leaf senescence in saplings of Fagus sylvatica growing in open-topped chambers compared with those in under simulated clear-sky solar UV-B radiation (Zeuthen et al. 1997). The delay in leaf senescence of A. platanoides under attenuated UV radiation below 350 nm could be attributable to leaves suffering less UV-induced photodamage (Zeuthen et al. 1997) throughout the growing season under this filter.

This confirms our hypothesis that shade-tolerant species would be less responsive to the filter treatments. In a study of tropical alpine plant types, no significant difference was found between the UV-screening in herbaceous species and woody species (Barnes et al. 2017). In contrast to this, a few comparative studies of plant types have suggested that the accumulation of UV-B absorbing compounds, is slightly more responsive to solar radiation in herbaceous species than in woody species, and that evergreen species are least responsive (Semerdjieva et al. 2003, Brzezinska and Kozlowska 2008, Li et al. 2010). These differences in flavonoid induction may be offset by higher constitutive contents of UV-B absorbing compounds in evergreen and woody species compared to herbaceous species (Semerdjieva et al. 2003, Li et al. 2010), possibly related to their greater leaf longevity, making investment in flavonoids worthwhile (Semerdjieva et al. 2003). However, we found that despite having shorter leaf longevity, the more light-demanding plants in our study had higher flavonol content throughout the season. Higher investment in flavonols by more light-demanding species may supplement other photoprotection mechanisms allowing species transient periods of high irradiance and canopy gaps to be exploited without severe photoinhibition (Takahashi and Badger, 2011). However, there were underlying seasonal trends in flavonol content under all our filter treatments, which implies that a variety of other factors, such as temperature and developmental stages of the plants, are also important determinants of leaf flavonol content (Pescheck and Bilger 2019, Hartikainen et al. 2019 submitted.", "figure_ref": ["fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "98d3fb23-e43b-43f4-8aca-f9c2e77976e7": {"text": "As we hypothesized, out of all our filter treatments, attenuation of blue light caused the largest reduction in adaxial epidermal flavonols in more light-demanding herbaceous species and deciduous tree seedlings (Fig. 4).

Likewise, in a growth room, simulated understory blue light increased leaf adaxial epidermal flavonol content via cryptochrome photoreceptors under controlled PAR conditions (Brelsford et al. 2019). Accordingly, much of the reduction in flavonols during canopy closure during summer (Fig. 4), could be attributable to the reduction in blue light reaching the understory. Epidermal flavonols responded differently to our treatments in Q. robur compared with most other species. Attenuating UV radiation below 350 nm had the largest effect on Q. robur flavonols.

Evergreen stands are warmer during the winter and cooler during the summer, because of the insulating effects of a dense closed canopy all year round (Davis et al. 2019).

Conversely, high heritability and high genetic variance of a trait would enable greater responses to selection pressures. On the other hand, highly heritable symbiont communities with low genotypic variation could be problematic for vertically-transmitting coral populations if adult communities are thermally sensitive [50]. We found moderate heritability of Symbiodinium communities in S. hystrix (ShA). Much greater heritability of the Symbiodinium community was expected in this vertically-transmitting coral, especially in comparison with what is known of other important reproductive and fitness traits.

Theory suggests that competition among symbionts may preclude transmission of an exact replica of the parental symbiont community because conditions promoting growth for some symbionts may differ between life stages [11]. The novel symbiont diversity found in S. hystrix (ShA) larvae may provide benefits similar to those observed in insect symbioses, for example to provide larvae with the flexibility to host optimal symbiont types for the changing conditions through ontogeny [20,27]. For example, Symbiodinium C1_OTU136, which was uniquely identified in larvae, may represent an adaptive advantage for this early life stage. Clade C types are taxonomically and physiologically diverse [10,64], and exhibit a range of tolerances for light and temperature, which are also reflected in their in hospite distributions across individual adult colonies and species [65]. Larval settlement and early juvenile survival are generally highest in cryptic, low-light areas that offer protection from predation [66,67]. Given that optimal settlement environments differ substantially from light environments experienced by adults, potentially by as much as 10-fold [67], it is possible that variation in Symbiodinium communities between larvae and adults observed here relates to different selective pressures associated with differing light environments [68\u201370]. Other potentially numerous, uncharacterized differences between larval and adult microhabitats may also contribute to differences in selective pressures between life stages. The potential ecological roles for the larval-specific OTUs recorded here are unknown. Indeed, it is possible that they represent non-symbiotic, free-living types [71] that may have attached to the exterior of the larvae following release or that may have entered brooded larvae without engaging in symbiosis. Further work is needed to determine how many of these OTUs represent physiologically important versus transient Symbiodinium.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "10fbdc03-c0b7-432f-b181-58ab02b679ea": {"text": "The immune system is an obvious mechanism by which the host could exert control over the symbiotic community by regulating the establishment of individual Symbiodinium types [72] or of either whole clades or functional units (i.e., clades or types with similar metabolic roles) [44].

Mechanisms of immunity that could be transmitted through inheritance of parental genes include components of both the innate and adaptive immune response, including some that have been implicated in shaping invertebrate symbiont communities, such as T-cells, Nod2, defensins, and antimicrobial peptides [as reviewed in 73,74].

The low level of variation in Symbiodinium communities associated with corals ranging in diameter from 8 cm to >30 cm [3-10 years; 85] suggests that the end of the winnowing process likely occurs earlier in the development of the brooding coral S. hystrix (ShA)(i.e., before 3 years) than in broadcast-spawning corals [~3.5 years; 26,27]. Although evidence for switching of symbiont communities in adults corals exists [86], the pre-winnowing period may be the most flexible time for hosts to associate with a diversity of microbes.

Thus differences at the meter-level scales found in this study could be important for structuring in hospite Symbiodinium diversity, and may be partly responsible for the variability found at the level of individual larvae and broods.

Furthermore, a recent study suggests that clustering across samples at 97% identity underestimates diversity instead of overestimating it [109]. Intragenomic variation and generation of false-positives is therefore substantially minimized by using across-sample clustering at 97% similarity, as we have employed. Single cell sequencing is currently financially and logistically outside the scope of studies that examine communities of hundreds of different Symbiodinium types (as with coral juveniles), with a majority of these types not yet existing in culture. It is questionable if microsatellite flanking regions provide superior taxonomic resolution [116], and as no known single-copy marker exists, using other markers in tandem with ITS-2 will only result in data representing multiple, multi-copy markers. We addressed intragenomic variation by clustering across samples at 97% similarity and also provided two additional analyses to test for their presence and potential impact on the heritability estimate; and both confirm the robust nature of our conclusions in regards to this issue. Overall, we undertook a three-step approach, as outlined in [95], to assess if multiple copies and intragenomic variation of ITS-2 genes could potentially bias abundance and heritability estimates across Symbiodinium types after clustering at 97% identity.

We, however, often ignore that the light quality (light spectrum) in the laboratory does not always mimic that of the natural environment in which phytoplankton thrive.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "eee759ea-399b-4894-aa89-21e7b91b8947": {"text": "Historically, laboratory studies investigating the physiological responses of marine phytoplankton species to environmental change have utilized \u2018daylight\u2019 or \u2018growth light\u2019 fluorescent bulbs to supply light for growth. These specific fluorescent bulbs have an emission spectrum that usually resembles that of the natural solar light experienced at the surface of the ocean (e.g. GE Daylight Ecolux\u00ae T12 fluorescent light bulbs). However, a disadvantage of using fluorescent bulbs is that they cannot easily replicate the dynamic and occasionally extreme high light intensity experienced by phytoplankton in nature, nor can their emission spectra be easily modified. Recently, light emitting diode (LED) based light incubators and stand-alone growth lights have become readily available. As LED systems have become more flexible and powerful, LED light incubators have also become more commonly utilized in culture studies of phytoplankton (see Schulze et al., 2014 for a review). One of the disadvantages of LEDs is, however, that their spectra are typically restricted to narrow emission peaks and hence a mixture of two or more LEDs are used to cover the major light spectra needed for growth of photoautotrophic cells. In order to understand wavelength specific responses of phytoplankton, multiple studies have been performed using different LED systems to quantify specific photosynthetic responses to distinct wavelengths (Abiusi et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2013; Marchetti et al., 2013; Miao et al., 2012; Rendon et al., 2013; Schellenberger Costa et al., 2013; Stadnichuk et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2013). However, the effects of LED systems designed to mimic natural spectra are sparsely investigated (G\u00f6ritz et al., 2017). While the laboratory settings provide a controlled environment for experiments, they usually have a limited capacity to simulate ecologically relevant light regimes which in turn limits the accuracy of projecting the findings to the real world.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "7859876d-48e8-4129-a37a-87a632df9951": {"text": "To better understand why growth light spectra matters it is important to recognize that all phytoplankton species contain a specific set of pigments. In general, phytoplankton pigments can be thought of as photoactive or photoprotective. Photoactive pigments\u2019 absorption contributes to energy capture which leads to electron transport and ATP and NADPH production, which are then used as energy for carbon fixation and other metabolic processes. Photoactive pigments include chlorophylls (like chl a) as well as accessory pigments, like xanthophylls or those found in cyanobacterial phycobilisomes. Photoprotective pigments can absorb excess light energy previously absorbed by chl a and dissipate it as heat or fluorescence, thus avoiding photodamage to the reaction centers in the photosystem. Carotenoids are generally thought of as the main photoprotective pigments found in algae and higher plants, however some such as fucoxanthin can be photosynthetically active (Wilson et al., 2008). Since the composition of photoactive and photoprotective pigments is species specific and as species can alter the relative contribution of pigments depending on light and nutrient availability, it is evident that the choice of growth light will affect phytoplankton in many, yet unknown ways. The goal of this study is to characterize physiological responses of three uniquely pigmented phytoplankton species to different light systems which could be used for phytoplankton culturing. To accomplish this, phytoplankton were cultured under traditionally used fluorescent light as well under three different LED systems with unique emission spectra.

In our tested species, we determined that the Kyocera light supplied significantly higher usable photons over the absorbance range for the species P. marinus and T. weissflogii, while Synechococcus did not exhibit any PUR differences between the different lights tested (Fig. 1). Consequently, our expectation would be that both P. marinus and T. weissflogii would display larger differences while Synechococcus would show only minor responses. As presented in the results, we, however, found no changes in growth rate between the examined light sources for all cultures (Fig. 2, Table S3). This suggests that despite having different amounts of PUR, both P. marinus and T. weissflogii utilized a relatively similar amount of the emitted light energy to fuel growth while surplus energy consequently must either be utilized by other metabolic processes or dissipated. Our findings on growth concur with previous studies which have demonstrated that marine phytoplankton maintain constant growth rates under different spectral quality with seemingly similar PAR light intensities (Marchetti et al., 2013; Rivkin, 1989; Schellenberger Costa et al., 2013; Vadiveloo et al., 2015).

We attribute some of the measured change to a lower absorbance of light in the in the blue 450-470 nm region and a higher absorbance in the yellow/green region where PE is strongly absorbing light (Fig. 1). Our spectral deconvolution identified higher PE/Chl a and PPC/Photoactive pigments ratios in the Aquarium acclimated cells compared to other treatments (Figure 1, Table S2). The dominance of PE in antenna complexes of phycobiliprotein containing cyanobacteria like Synechococcus sp. could potentially explain the discrepancy of a constant 14C PP while O2 PP was enhanced in the Kyocera compared to the Bright White LED acclimated cells. The different lighting conditions could cause PE to be associated with PSI rather than PSII, called state transition, leading to changes in electron flow through the photosystem. Under state II, PE would be associated to PSI and oxygen evolution will be reduced while electrons could be undergoing enhanced cyclic electron transport around PSI (Bailey et al., 2008).

Photophysiological adjustments, not manifested in pigment content changes, could allow the cells to balance photosynthetically usable light absorption and alter linear and cyclic electron transport, which will ultimately change the cellular ratio of ATP to NADPH. Thus, the production of different metabolites could be regulated in these cells, leading to changes observed in cellular POC and PON. In all of our species tested, it is also possible that a small decrease in cell size could have caused changes of cellular chl a and POC/PON. For example, the strong decrease in chl a between Kyocera and Aquarium light in Synechococcus sp. could have been caused by a 25% decrease in cell diameter assuming a constant chl a cell-1 ratio.

While spectral sensitivity has been tested previously in several studies, an analysis of commercially available growth lights has not been conducted. The responses to the different growth lights used in this study were minimal in growth and productivity, however, responses in cellular composition, pigmentation, and estimated P vs. I curve parameters were all unique. In this study, distinct changes in POC, PON, C:N ratios and pigments were observed for each species. This is notable as it demonstrates the influence of growth light spectra on cell composition, which is important to keep in mind when performing laboratory experiments to constrain the biochemical composition of phytoplankton and their impact on biogeochemical cycles. We believe that cells growing under a light spectrum with low emission in the region where photoactive pigments absorb \u201csense\u201d that they are growing in a lower light environment and may thus adapt their physiology accordingly. These findings could be important as several commercially sold LED incubators use Bright White LED systems, which might not be an ideal spectrum for all cultured species. While our measured responses seemed to be minor in many ways, experiments which investigate diurnal cycles under variable light intensities (sinus shape day night cycles, variable fluctuating light condition) could result in phytoplankton species being high-light stressed under relative low PAR intensities. Consequently, paying attention to spectral matching of emission and absorbance spectra can prove valuable in photobioreactors cultivation, particularly when used for the production of a desired cellular product (e.g. Abiusi et al., 2014; Baer et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2010; Walter et al., 2011).

A simple \u201cblue light, red light\u201d combination of LEDs does not necessarily improve productivity, yet if specified to the absorbance to the cultured species it might.

In general, relations found between leaf reflectance and pigments (Fig. 3), confirm and strengthen the notion that leaf spectral reflectance in the visible to NIR range, can be used as effective proxy for leaf pigments (and biochemistry) also in macrophytes. Optimal wavelengths for Chl-a predictions were found in the red-edge range (i.e. 700-800 nm), similar to what extensively documented for terrestrial plants (Gitelson ; le Maire ; F\u00e9ret ; Wang & Li, 2012), with VIP of PLSR model peaking around 705-710 nm. High NDSI-pigments correlations outside of PAR range, where pigments absorption is virtually null, can be attributed to interactions with other leaf traits (Supplementary Fig. S8), i.e. correlation with LMA for Car (r = +0.52) and Chl/Car (r = \u22120.48). Instead, best performing spectral combinations for Ca/Cb ratio found around 2200 nm is possibly driven by the link between Ca/Cb and N content (Kitajima & Hogan, 2003), which we did not measure and it is known to show absorption features around 2180 nm from previous works (Kokaly, 2001; Li ).", "figure_ref": ["fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "280920c6-1f1c-49be-bf32-bce80ab02c5b": {"text": "The similarity between chlorophyll-a fluorescence dynamics and growth data suggests a close mechanistic link between photophysiological features and actual metabolism of plants (Genty ; Peterson ).

Best results were scored for Fv/Fm (RCV2 = 0.21), with optimal spectral range very similar to photochemical reflectance index (PRI) linked to light use efficiency and xanthophyll cycle (Harris ), and qP (RCV2 = 0.33), whose best spectral proxies were found in the SWIR range, roughly around 1400-1500 nm, probably due to co-variation of qP with DMC (r = +0.32). Sensitivity of chlorophyll fluorescence measures even to moderate environmental variations, paired with the large spatial-temporal variability typical of macrophyte populations - in the form of either trait variability within monospecific stands or specific trait distributions within mixed communities (Thomaz et al., 2009; Bornette & Puijalon, 2011) - and represented into our empirical dataset (Fig. 1; Table 1; Supplementary Table S1), could constitute a relevant obstacle to the establishment of general reflectance-photophysiology traits models, requiring specific spectral models limited to species and/or phenological stages (Supplementary Fig. S2-S7), as done by Stratoulias & T\u00f3th (2020) for Phragmites.", "figure_ref": ["fig1"], "table_ref": ["tbl1"]}, "3d5e6bc7-221a-4dde-87c0-db46d811f773": {"text": "Summarizing, our results demonstrate that spectral reflectance can be used for reliably estimating specific macrophyte leaf traits (Chl-a, Chl/Car, DMC and LMA), which are strongly connected to variability expressed within the LES in terms of trade-off between structural investment and photosynthetic efficiency (Poorter ; Onoda ), by using normalized spectral indices or PLSR modelling based on an empirical dataset collected across sites, seasons, and species. This finding provide the basis for using leaf spectra as a surrogate for high-throughput assessment of variability in macrophyte traits over scales and gradients, and support the extension of the reflectance-based trait modelling to RS spectroscopic data for enhancing the level of detail of functional diversity analysis. In particular, the possibility of using spectral proxies for modelling macrophyte LMA - a key trait in the LES as well as biodiversity variable (Pettorelli ) - opens intriguing perspectives in aquatic species diversity and functioning, for future research and ecological applications of RS, aiming at large scale and investigating spatial and temporal gradients.

Concurrently, the oceans have already absorbed approximately 25 million tonnes of emitted CO2 every day. This has stimulated a decrease in pH (~0.1 unit) in the surface layer of oceans and is projected to reach a mean of pH 7.8 by the end of 2100 (IPCC, 2013). CO2-induced ocean acidification (OA) has received substantial attention and believed to cause combined interactive effects on marine ecosystems (Orr et al., 2005; Doney et al., 2009; Cornwall et al., 2013). In terms of the impact of OA on marine calcifiers, including calcifying macroalgae, the main focus has been the possible direct impacts of decreasing the availability of carbonate ions (CO32\u2212) and carbonate saturation (Moya et al., 2012; Hofmann et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2020a). In common with previous studies, OA generally has a negative effect on the biomineralization process caused by reduced seawater pH and aragonite saturation state (\u03a9) (Ries et al., 2009; 2010; Comeau et al., 2017). Campbell et al. (2016) have reported that under elevated pCO2 conditions (2400 ppmv), calcification rates of two calcifying macroalgae species (Halimeda opuntia and H. simulans) declined by 32% and 49%, respectively. These conclusions have signified that the consequences of OA are expected to reduce the distribution of calcifiers, CaCO3 stocks and biomass, which will result in various changes in habitat structure and ecological function for marine ecosystems worldwide (Gao et al., 1993; Kleypas and Yates, 2009). However, variable effects have been reported because some species display relatively minor responses to OA. Peach et al. (2017) noted that calcification and growth rates varied among six Halimeda species, but with no obvious effects at elevated pCO2 (1300 ppmv). Although species-level variation in response to OA has been documented in rates of calcification and growth in field and laboratory experiments, significant gaps still exist in our knowledge of the metabolic response to OA by calcifiers due to the interactive effects of other dynamic environmental parameters and different meta-analyses (Fabry et al., 2008; Doney et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2020a).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "01cbe677-ecc5-4981-b1a8-f731d1f33b37": {"text": "Calcifying macroalgae are considered to be an important part of coral reef ecosystems as their calcium carbonate endoskeletons are laid down and provide vast, three-dimensional structures and shelters for many coral inhabitants (Wei et al., 2020b). In the open ocean, light is another vital environmental factor for the growth and distribution of macroalgae (Zou and Gao, 2010). Variations in light availability can affect algal photosynthesis, carbohydrate synthesis and substance accumulation through photo energy absorbed by light-harvesting complexes (Porzio et al., 2011; Celis-Pl\u00e1 et al., 2017). Previous studies have found that moderate increases in light intensity have a positive influence on the physiological performance of fleshy and calcifying macroalgae (Teichberg et al., 2013; Bao et al., 2019). Teichberg et al. (2013) pointed out that in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, the growth, photosynthetic performance and tissue composition (total organic carbon and nitrogen) of H. opuntia at depths of 5 m were significantly higher than those at 15 m mainly due to differences in the incidence of underwater light. High sunlight in relatively shallow marine environments provides sufficient solar energy for calcifying macroalgae to uptake bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) through carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) (Borowitzka and Larkum, 1976; Koch et al., 2013). As CO2 dissolved in seawater can increase the concentration of HCO3\u2212, which is used for the assimilation of biogenic calcium carbonate (Orr et al., 2005), it is essential to conduct experiments that combine OA scenarios with other factors such as light availability (Hofmann et al., 2014).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "5b1e3e57-66cd-4c53-b194-6c81afbea7df": {"text": "The genus Halimeda (Bryopsidales) is composed of calcified green segments that play a major role as carbonate sediment producers and is distributed widely in tropical and subtropical marine ecosystems (Payri, 1988; Sinutok et al., 2012; Wizemann et al., 2015). It has been estimated that Halimeda species produce 0.15\u20130.40 Gt of CaCO3 m\u22122 year\u22121, accounting for around 8.0% of the total calcium production of coral reef ecosystems (Milliman, 1993; Hillis, 1997). Thus, Halimeda species are considered a carbon sink for the long-term carbon storage of atmospheric CO2 emissions (Kinsey and Hopley, 1991; Rees et al., 2007). The calcification of this genus is a light-driven process, requiring functional chloroplasts in superficial utricles to remove CO2 from the seawater into interfilamental spaces (Borowitzka and Larkum, 1976). Substantial studies have shown that OA brings negative influences on growth, calcification, photosynthesis and other aspects of the physiological performance of Halimeda (Hofmann et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2020a). Under elevated pCO2 stress, malondialdehyde (MDA) content in these calcifying macroalgae significantly increases. MDA is a secondary end product of oxidative lipid degradation in cells and has deleterious effects on protein synthesis and nucleic acid reactions (Xiong et al., 2002; Hemm et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2019; 2020a).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "fd31f013-7514-4372-9b76-3d6c2ba452c8": {"text": "It is essential that marine macroalgae make suitable modifications to deal with OA stress.

Hofmann et al. (2014) suggested that under OA conditions (pH 7.75\u00b10.05), the external carbonic anhydrase activity (eCAA) of H. opuntia significantly increased to enhance photosynthetic performance and carbon accumulation abilities. However, it is still not known whether marine calcifying organisms will be able to tolerate future conditions, as the cumulative effects of continued OA drive these calcifying species closer to the limits of their physiological tolerances (O\u2019Donnell et al., 2010; Koch et al., 2013).

In common with previous studies, the data in the present study suggest that OA leads to deleterious impacts on growth rates, calcification and photosynthesis processes in calcifying macroalga species of H. opuntia (Fig. 1; Fig. 2). However, this study further revealed that photosynthetic products, such as SC, SP and FAA contents (Fig. 7), as well as relative enzymatic activities (Fig. 6), increased notably under higher light intensity, which could favor an enhanced performance in photosynthesis (Fig. 2-4), and tissue carbon and nitrogen accumulation (Fig. 5). The results indicate that moderately increased light availability could enhance the key anti-stress abilities of H. opuntia in response to OA. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies reported by Wei et al. (2019; 2020a), who suggested that OA and increased light influenced photosynthesis, calcification and other physiological performances of two Halimeda species (H. cylindracea and H. lacunalis) in opposing directions, and the positive influences of moderate increases in light availability could offset the adverse effects of the decline in pH caused by elevated pCO2.", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig2", "fig7", "fig6", "fig2", "fig4", "fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "147a7f5c-1877-47ad-8c73-87a08b12914f": {"text": "In this study, H. opuntia performed lower RGR and calcification rate (Gnet) in ambientpCO2 conditions. Most of the previous work on Halimeda species (Teichberg et al., 2013; Hofmann et al., 2014; Campbell et al., 2016; Peach et al., 2017) and other marine calcifiers (Hofmann et al, 2008; Manzello, 2010; O\u2019Donnell et al., 2010) under OA has focused on reduced growth, calcification and primary productivity. With CO2 enrichment, the components of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) drastically shifted and aragonite saturation state (\u03a9Arag) decreased (Table 2), which may contribute to the dissolution of calcium carbonate structures formed in algal tissues (Orr et al., 2005; Anderson et al., 2009). The decline in Gnet presented here confirms the susceptibility of algal skeleton formation to slight changes in environmental pH values (Hofmann et al., 2014). Notably, enhancements of RGR and Gnet were pronounced under increased light availability. As has been observed in other Halimeda species under OA, the calcification data provide evidence that increased light could be able to compensate for elevated pCO2 levels through the up-regulation of photosynthesis (Fig. 3) (V\u00e1squez-Elizondo and Enr\u00edquez, 2016; Campbell et al., 2016). This is probably because algal calcification is energetically dependent on photosynthesis and could provide a high fraction of the energetic costs of the biomineralization process (Chisholm, 2000, 2003; Meyer et al., 2016). As calcification occurs in semi-enclosed inter-utricular spaces in H. opuntia, efficient photosynthesis aids crystal growth via CO2 removal and the elevation of intracellular pH (Campbell et al., 2016). Peach et al. (2017) also pointed out that increased photosynthesis may compensate for the adverse influences on algal calcification processes in response to OA, and contribute to skeletal CaCO3 precipitation.", "figure_ref": ["fig3"], "table_ref": ["tbl2"]}, "fdde1bf5-eed6-4c96-9718-a23bb0422f56": {"text": "Elevated pCO2 caused adverse impacts on thallus photosynthesis in H. opuntia, and the severity of this impact was observed under low light condition (30 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121), resulting in declines in Fv/Fm and rETR (Fig. 2; Fig. 4a, b). A similar negative impact by elevated pCO2 on algal photosynthesis has been reported for other Halimeda species (Price et al., 2011; Sinutok et al., 2012; Compbell et al., 2015; Meyer et al., 2016). Price et al. (2011) found that H. opuntia had carbonate dissolution and a reduction in photosynthetic capacity after two weeks of exposure to pCO2 at 900 \u00b1 90 ppmv. However, the specific reasons for these declines have not been concluded. According to the results of our 28-day experiments, it could be proposed that increasing dissolved CO2 in seawater reduced pH, which may depress the expression of CCMs in terms of DIC acquisition (Price et al., 2011). Although CCMs could enhance photosynthetic efficiency, they were energetic cost processes resulting from the activities of anhydrase to catalyze the hydration of CO2 and active ion pumping across membranes (Prins et al., 1982). As elevated pCO2 caused the degradation of CCM induction, algal photosynthesis majorly relied on passive CO2 diffusion, and thus the efficiency of photosynthetic carbon assimilation was critically limited. The maintenance of high proton-H+ permeability of the plasma membrane, which is essential for photosynthetic bicarbonate assimilation (Elzenga and Prins, 1989), declined at reduced external pH (Miedema and Prins, 1991). According to our results, the excess dissolved CO2 compromised both photophysiology and \u03a9Arag for calcification in H. opuntia, indicating that OA may bring adverse synergistic depressions for this calcifying species. The metabolic suppression of photosynthesis and calcification activities suggests that either there is a decreased demand for ATP or that metabolism was actively suppressed as an acute survival response. This would potentially allow the reallocation of energy to a more immediate stress response, such as mucus production, which needs the maintenance of intracellular pH homeostasis and/or immune defense (Moya et al., 2012).", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "b30c03e5-38e4-47a8-a5b6-b0f9e6cfd83f": {"text": "Concurrently, H. opuntia can resist the environmental stress caused by rapid seawater changes in OA by regulating pigment synthesis. A significant decline in Chl a content with elevated pCO2 (Fig. 4a) suggested pigment degradation or/and increases in light stress (Sinutok et al., 2012). However, carotenoid content, especially in low light conditions were remarkably accumulated and may function to take full use of light energy during periods of lower irradiance (Boardman, 1977; Teichberg et al., 2013). Based on the photosynthetic performance, although values of Fv/Fm (0.665\u20130.704) declined in elevated pCO2, it remained at a relatively normal level after 28-day incubation, which indicates that the effects of a moderate increase in light availability could offset the severe impacts of low pH (Wei et al., 2020a). The rapid light curves for rETR were significantly enhanced by increasing light intensities as displayed in Fig. 2. V\u00e1squez-Elizondo and Enr\u00edquez (2016, 2017) suggested that changes in the internal carbon and nitrogen partitioning of the algal thallus induced by elevated pCO2 (as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 in this study) affected the optical properties of the antenna size of the photosystems.

Similar conclusions have been reached in some other comparative studies and it was proposed that these C and N accumulations resulted from characterizations of enzymatic-driven activities, especially for the eCAA and NRA (Hofmann et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017; 2018). In the present study, CO2 enrichment as well as increased light intensities positively enhanced eCAA of H. opuntia, which catalyzes CO2 and HCO3\u2212 interconversion and ensures that the substrate for Rubisco remains at a normal equilibrium at the site of carboxylation under elevated pCO2 (Moya et al., 2012; Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2013; Hofmann et al., 2014). As a result of increasing dissolved CO2 in seawater (Table 2), concentration gradients between the seawater environment and algal cytoplasm may function to favor the diffusion of CO2 and HCO3\u2212 (Moroney et al., 1985; Zou and Gao, 2004). Thus, the SC synthesis in H. opuntia was enhanced by the positive effects of CA activity and elevated pCO2 (Fig. 7a), which resulted in an improvement in the irradiance harvesting capacity to absorb light and the up-regulation of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (Van Oijen et al., 2004). Moreover, CO2 enrichment in this study was considered to significantly increase both NRA and TN accumulation in H. opuntia (Fig. 5; Fig. 6), which is consistent with the conclusions reported by Chen et al. (2016; 2017) and Wei et al. (2020a). Indeed, a positive correlation between increased light availability and higher TN content was observed during the experimental period, even though it was not statistically significant (P = 0.168) (Table 4). These results indicate that higher light might cause metabolic modifications in H. opuntia to mitigate OA stress, which is confirmed by both the higher photosynthetic rates and soluble organic osmolytes (Fig.7).", "figure_ref": ["fig5", "fig7", "fig5", "fig6", "fig7"], "table_ref": ["tbl2"]}, "df6816ea-736d-47b1-8477-3b2c35db20c8": {"text": "It has been suggested that soluble organic molecules may play roles in buffering metabolic depression to cope with OA challenges (Xiong et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017; 2018; Wei et al., 2020a). Light-mediated changes in cellular biochemical composition were associated with the acclimation of algal growth and photosynthesis (Zou and Gao, 2013). Under elevated pCO2, SC and SP contents were remarkably higher than those of H. opuntia tissues under control pCO2 as displayed in Fig. 7. As the SC content increased, the cytoplasmic concentration was promoted whereas the permeability of the plasma membrane declined (Xiong et al., 2002). These modifications contribute to membrane integrity and ensure cellular activities function well, and could provide the physiological basis for the resistance of adverse external environments by algal cells (Sun et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2020a). Such shifts in metabolic performance may result from the enhancement of internal and external CA activities that facilitates the conversion of CO2 and HCO3\u2212 to satisfy photosynthetic carbon demand (De Beer and Larkum, 2001). Thus, increased SC contents in H. opuntia favored the enhancement of resilience against OA stress. The SP content was another important indicator of plant metabolism (Sun et al., 2015). Based on the results (Fig. 7b), an obvious trend in CO2-induced promotion of SP content was observed in CO2 enrichment treatments. Yang et al. (2009) pointed out that a higher SP accumulation works in increasing key enzyme activities for plant photosynthesis and accelerating substance and energy metabolism. Furthermore, consistent with previous studies (Rizhsky et al., 2004; Foug\u00e8re et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2020a), it is reasonable to suggest that the stimulation of FAAs might increase the anti-oxidative capacity of H. opuntia. Wei et al. (2020a) demonstrated that under elevated pCO2 (1600 ppmv), proline contents, one of the FAAs in both H. cylindracea and H. lacunalis, were two- to four-fold higher than those in ambient pCO2 (400 ppmv).

Fig. 2 presents 1D 13C MAS-NMR spectra of PsbS at neutral and low pH. Direct 13C polarization MAS NMR was applied because the dimensions of PsbS in detergent micelles are such that rotational correlation dynamics averages dipolar nuclear couplings, reducing the efficiency of cross-polarization based MAS NMR, while the sizes are too large for detection of rigid protein sites by solution NMR. At pH 7.5, two clear peaks at 181.7 ppm and 178.0 ppm are observed of deprotonated Glu and Asp carboxylic-acid side chains (Fig. 2A). At pH 5.0 (Fig. 2B), these two peaks fully disappear while gain of signal is observed of shoulders at 179.3 and 177.1 ppm. It is well known that protonation of Glu and Asp induces an upfield shift the carboxyl 13C NMR resonances. We therefore can interpret the signal change as an indication that most of the titratable Asp and Glu residues, 19 in total for P. patens PsbS, are protonated at pH 5.0.

A more precise assignment can be made by carefully inspecting the 2DIR spectrum in Fig. 4B. First, the band anharmonicity (\u0394) is an important parameter that reflects the extent of backbone Amide coupling and can help distinguish between structured and unstructured elements. The anharmonicity of the 1630 cm\u22121 transition here was determined to be 13 cm\u22121 on the basis of the difference of the v = 0 \u27f6 1 and v = 1 \u27f6 2 peak maxima. Uncoupled Amide I oscillators carry \u0394 values of 16 cm\u22121 and this value inversely scales with the degree of excitonic coupling between Amide I oscillators. For example, an \u0251-helix or \u03b2-sheet generally ranges from 9-14 cm\u22121 suggesting this element corresponds to an ordered structure and is therefore not representative of a coil or loop. Second, we can discriminate between a \u03b2-sheet and helical response on the basis of its peak pattern. Since \u03b2-sheets typically exhibit a characteristic \u201cZ-shaped\u201d peak pattern in the overall 2DIR spectrum, which is not observed here, we conclude that the 1630 cm\u22121 feature corresponds to a helical element. This is in agreement with the X-ray structure and CD data of Psb which indicate no extensive \u03b2-sheet content. A similar reasoning may be applied to the two band pairs at 1638 and 1660 cm\u22121, which show similar band anharmonicity and peak patterns to that at 1630 cm\u22121 indicating distinct helical elements.

We note that in the X-ray structure, TM2 does not span the entire membrane at the luminal side (see Fig. 1A) and by mutation of Glu-1, the unstructured part adjacent to TM2 that loops into the lumen has the potential to fold into TM2, especially given that the TM2 sequence is similar to that of the pseudo-symmetry-related TM4. The spectrum of the M1/M2 mutant at neutral pD (Fig. S3B, orange line) shows a diminished 1630 cm\u22121 band relative to that at 1655 cm\u22121 as well, which means that its fold may be similarly altered with respect to wild type, as in the M1 mutant.", "figure_ref": ["fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "0ec382e0-228c-4d05-ac53-42a45460660c": {"text": "The non-native folds of M1 and M1/M2 could be due to a non-native charge distribution in the loop connecting TM1 with TM2.

In contrast, at the Glu-2 site, there are no additional titratable residues in the loop and H2, and elimination of the Glu-2 charge gives an overall charge of this segment that resembles the charge distribution of the wild type at low pH. In addition, the segment containing Glu-2 forms a well-defined structural element (i.e. an amphipathic helix of 9 amino acids) and its conformation should be less affected by a point mutation than the loop containing Glu-1 that is only locally structured, containing a short helix fragment H1 and a short 310 helix fragment that carries Glu-1. 310 helices are known to be intrinsically unstable, which is also demonstrated in the MD study of Liguori et al. .

Notably, while H3 refolding was first proposed in MD simulations of Liguori et al. and consistent with the FTIR and 2DIR signals, the pH-dependent repositioning of H2 was not observed in the MD simulations. This discrepancy could have several explanations. The limited time window after pH change in the simulation, which was 4.7 \u03bcs, may have precluded such observation: stimulus-induced conformational changes in proteins may take place on much longer timescales than that, i.e. from sub-milliseconds to milliseconds, and specific methods in MD are required to predict such slow dynamics. Furthermore, in the current work, the H2 motion is revealed in (primarily) dimeric PsbS in detergent micelles; the MD simulations were conducted on a PsbS monomer, as taken from the dimeric X-ray structure, and equilibrated in a POPC lipid bilayer, which renders the system flat and planar. The latter difference between our experimental systems and the MD simulations may also contribute to the discrepancies in the results with respect to protonation. The NMR and FTIR data show that all titratable residues are protonated at pH 5.0, including Glu-1 and Glu-2, which are essential for the lumen acidification response in vivo. Our results indicate that also titratable residues at the stromal site have pKa\u2019s that are significantly shifted with respect to their pKa\u2019s in aqueous solvent whereas the MD study predicts that the stromal residues have very low pKa\u2019s.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "20659537-ea7f-4c53-92b9-5874fa803bde": {"text": "We now discuss how a pH-dependent repositioning of helix H2 and refolding of 310 helix H3 may be coupled to the pH-sensing function of PsbS. In the spinach PsbS crystal structure, Glu-1 (E69 in the X-ray structure) is located in a loop fragment close to H3 that connects two transmembrane helices TM1 and TM2, whereas Glu-2 (E173 in the X-ray structure) is located in the amphipathic short helix H2 at the water-membrane interface facing the lumen, and connects TM3 and TM4 (Fig. 1A,C). These elements form an important part of the PsbS dimerization interface (Fig. 1D): the backbone carbonyl and side chain carboxyl of Glu-2 each can form a hydrogen bond with two backbone amides of I74 and Y75 close to Glu-1 of the adjacent monomer, as schematically shown in Fig. 1E. In P. patens PsbS, the latter two amino acids are L74 and T75 (note that the different nature of the side chains in P. patens vs. spinach will not have an immediate effect because the hydrogen bonding takes place to the backbone amides). The I74 and Y75 residues form the short 310 helix fragment H3 that was predicted to unfold at neutral pH, constituting a molecular response to pH. It was proposed that including this response, a network of tunable electrostatic interactions could create a pH-sensitive docking mechanism for PsbS. Here, we have shown that helix H2 exhibits pH-dependent structural dynamics in concert with H3, suggesting that their motion forms an integral part of the pH-dependent regulation pathway. In addition to the absence of motion for H2, we find no indication of pH-dependent H3 refolding in the M2 mutant according to the 2DIR results. Thus, the luminal loop element that contains Glu-1 and partly folds into H3 at low pH in WT PsbS, has its structural pH response abolished when Glu-2 is replaced by Gln. In the M2 mutant, H3 in the 310 conformation is able to form a native-like dimer interaction with helix H2 of its dimerization partner. We hypothesize that in the M2 mutant, H3 retains its 310 conformation at neutral pH because H2 of its dimerization partner remains in the hydrophobic phase and provides an energetically favorable hydrogen bonding site, even with deprotonation of Glu-1.", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig1", "fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "cf35b2ff-448a-4a57-a1a9-88784f4cb30b": {"text": "Considering our results and that of earlier MD simulations, both Glu sites have shown to undergo specific pH-dependent conformational changes that could affect the interaction of PsbS with itself or other interaction partners in a membrane. Indeed, in-vivo studies show that both M1 and M2 mutants have altered NPQ response according to Li et al. We find that at both pH conditions, the PsbS M2 mutant resides in a pseudo-WT low-pH conformational state, which is considered the active state of the protein. This is in apparent contradiction with in vivo results that indicate that mutation of Glu-2 partially impairs the NPQ response . The observed partial activity in vivo may result from the function of PsbS to interact with other type of proteins, like LHCII. The M2 mutant has a fixed position of H2 but could still confer a pH-dependent switching capability through the protonation state of Glu-1 in H3, and establish reversible interactions with flexible amphipatic helices of other types of proteins. In our isolated protein system, however, PsbS can only interact with itself. This means that in the M2 PsbS dimer, the interacting partner site of H3 (i.e. the amphipatic helix H2 of the other monomer) is in a fixed position, thereby locking also the conformation and positioning of H3. In addition, the reduced NPQ activity of Glu-2 mutants in plants suggests that not only the activation of PsbS, but its ability to switch on and off is crucial for its function.

It has been established that in vivo, PsbS interacts with LHCs under high light conditions. PsbS is a member of the LHC superfamily, where proteins function as pH switches (namely PsbS and LHCSR) and/or photoprotective switches that can alternate between fluorescent and excitation-quenched states (namely LHCII and LHCSR). LHCs share a structure in which transmembrane helices are connected via amphipathic short helices at the luminal site . As we mentioned, in isolation PsbS self-interacts to form dimers as described above. For interactions of PsbS with LHCs, the corresponding symmetry-equivalent luminal amphipathic helices of the latter proteins would provide a putative dimerization site. From our experimental results, we predict that (i) these LHC amphipathic helices need to be located in the membrane phase for proper positioning with respect to the PsbS helix H3 and (ii) these LHC amphipathic helices need to respond to pH (i.e., undergo a motion similar to that of H2 in PsbS) in order tune the strength of PsbS \u2013 LHC interactions. Otherwise, H3 may remain constitutively folded as is likely the case for the PsbS M2 mutant, and the interaction is not switched on and off with varying the pH. Strikingly, the symmetry-related luminal amphipathic helices of LHC contain several titratable residues (Asp, Glu)  which may enable such functionality.

Broadleaf deciduous trees and shrubs are also present, and sometimes deciduous conifers such as Larch (Larix) species, but there is no doubt that evergreen conifers are particularly well adapted to harsh boreal conditions, including short growing seasons and cold, snowy winters. Thus, evergreen conifers\u2019 adaptations to boreal regions must presumably include regulatory processes that protect the photosynthetic apparatus in their needles during the harsh winter and early spring. Knowledge of photoprotective mechanisms in various kinds of photosynthetic organisms has increased considerably in recent decades. Several control systems have been identified that allow the photosynthesis machinery to harmlessly dissipate excess excitation energy. In 2003, \u00d6quist and Huner published a seminal review of photosynthesis in evergreen plants, which pointed out that overwintering conifer needles enter a state of \u2018sustained quenching\u2019 during winter. They found strong evidence for major alterations in the organization and composition of the photosystem II (PS II) antenna but also concluded that photosystem I (PS I) may play an important role, via nonphotochemical quenching of absorbed light or via quenching absorbed light photochemically through cyclic electron transport. Recently it was also shown that alternative electron transport might add up to this as well. Up to date there exists no clear mechanism rationalizing winter quenching in conifers, although there are several proposed hypotheses. Several protection mechanisms may also occur in parallel, and (if so) they are likely activated largely well before the extreme stress occurs. But the major conundrum arises in early spring, when temperatures are typically still low, so plants\u2019 biochemical and metabolic activities are strongly limited, but solar radiation is already high.

Y(NA) did not change much during recovery (Fig. 1E-II). Y(ND) increased slightly during the first 3 h, but then gradually decreased, and ESR samples did not quite reach S values.

We therefore assign this highly quenched component to the quenched LHCII antenna energetically disconnected from both PSII and PSI. However, the addition of this quenched LHCII compartment was not sufficient to fully describe the fluorescence kinetics (SI 4.4).

Also, the PSII and PSI kinetics became well-separated in such a model. The resolved direct energy transfer rate from PSII to PSI is quite high (2.3 ns-1), implying that a part of energy absorbed by PSII is actually funneled to PSI.

In the SQ needles the percentage of energy flowing into the PSII reaction center drops to 7.1%, while it increases to 67% for PSI. Upon strong light illumination most of PSII reaction centers will be closed, and a fraction of that total energy flowing through the RC can produce harmful reactive species like ROS. Since the percentage of energy flow into PSII decreases 10 times (70% in S and 7.1% in SQ) in SQ as compared to S, this means that the potential of oxidative damage is reduced by a factor of 10 by the quenching process. This factor is increased by a further factor of approx. 2 due to the large pool of functionally detached and quenched LHCII. So, in SQ needles the overall quenching provides a protection factor of 20 for PSII compared to S needles. In the sustained quenched ES samples this effect is much more extreme: Only 1.5% of the total absorbed energy in the system flows through the PSII reaction center potentially causing oxidative damage (assuming all other factors are equal).

Hence, all overwintering conifers must develop highly efficient mechanisms for photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus.

However, in the case of ES samples it is strongly suggested by the data that the high levels of \u03a6NO do reflect the \u0394pH-independent \u201csustained\u201d energy quenching. Our lifetime data provide an explanation for the origin of this component: A very high rate of direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI, provides this delta-pH independent (non-qE) quenching of PSII. Other phtoto protective mechanisms proposed, such as, role of photo-inactivated PSII complexes may also effectively dissipate excess excitation energy as heat, and since the photoinhibitory quenching (qI), dependent on inactivation and/or degradation of D1, relaxes within hours (or longer), the process could also be considered a form of \u2018sustained quenching\u2019. Moreover, the involvement of RC quenching, based on enhanced S2QA- and S2QB-charge recombination, favoring non-radiative PSII RC dissipation of excess light, has been suggested to supplement or even replace the fast component of non-photochemical quenching during winter, and thus play a significant role in overwintering conifers. However, we found no indication of photo inhibited PSII centers in the unrelaxed ES samples that displayed sustained quenching. A component with these characteristics was not observed in the ES samples. However, even if it would be present it could not explain the strong quenching effect since this component has longer average lifetime and higher fluorescence yield than the intact PSII units. In addition, we found no experimental evidence for PSII RC quenching either. All rate constants obtained from target modeling of the PSII antenna/RC pools in both unquenched and quenched states are quite normal. Thus, neither photoinhibition nor RC quenching alone could explain the strong \u2018sustained quenching\u2019. Moreover, changes in Y(I) suggest a lowered activity of PSI, even though PSI activity was less affected than PSII. In the absence of carbon fixation, one would expect higher acceptor side limitation, but contrastingly we found Y(NA) less affected, and donor side limitation [Y(ND)] was very high (Compared to S).

Acclimation to early spring conditions (Fig 6-II) results in massive loss of grana stacks (destacking) and formation of uniform membrane structures of stromal thylakoids. This allows for a redistribution and randomization of PSII and PSI. The reduction in the spatial distance between PSII and PSI complexes increases the probability for direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI. This protective mechanism severely restricts linear electron flow since it strongly quenches PSII activity. It also has strong similarities to the potent quenching observed in other extreme environmental conditions when PSII requires strong protection.

On the other hand, thylakoid rearrangement and movement of complexes are likely coupled to the high zeaxanthin content (SI 6 Table 2), and probably to pronounced phosphorylation of antenna and core proteins present under these conditions. In this situation, the excess energy is dissipated primarily through direct energy transfer from PSII to PSI, which appears in steady-state (PAM) fluorescence measurements as a non-regulated constitutive energy quenching.

The attenuation of sunlight with depth is consequently a critical aspect of shelf sea water quality (Kirk 1988), and can strongly control the productivity and areal extent of light-dependent benthic ecosystems (Gattuso et al. 2006).

Moreover, because their absorption and backscattering spectra differ, the attenuation of an equal amount of sunlight by different constituents results in a different spectral distribution of light underwater. DOM absorbs most strongly at short wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) and blue range, and therefore plays an important role in protecting marine organisms from harmful UV radiation (Arrigo & Brown 1996, Banaszak & Lesser 2009, H\u00e4der et al. 2015). Yet by also absorbing blue light, DOM can shift the underwater irradiance to longer wavelengths that are less effectively absorbed by many photosynthetic organisms.

Although CDOM is also produced by bacteria and phytoplankton in the ocean (Coble 2007, Dainard & Gu\u00e9guen 2013, Osburn et al. 2019), dissolved organic matter that originates from the partial decomposition of terrestrial vegetation is particularly strongly light-absorbent (Vantrepotte et al. 2015, Massicotte et al. 2017). The flux of this CDOM-rich terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (terrigenous DOC, or tDOC) from land to coastal oceans is a quantitatively significant part of the global carbon cycle and has increased by tens of percent in many parts of the world (Evans et al. 2005, Monteith et al. 2007, Moore et al. 2013). In Europe and North America, these trends may be largely driven by the recent reductions in atmospheric acid deposition, because high acid deposition can reduce organic matter solubility in soils (Skjelkv\u00e5le et al. 2005, Evans et al. 2006, Monteith et al. 2007). However, climate warming, increased water run-off, and land-use change are also driving increased tDOC fluxes both in high- and low-latitude regions (Hessen et al. 2010, Larsen et al. 2011, Weyhenmeyer et al. 2012, Moore et al. 2013, de Wit et al. 2016, Noacco et al. 2017, Wauthy et al. 2018). CDOM is an integral part of tDOC, and the concentrations of tDOC and of CDOM are therefore highly correlated in rivers and river plumes (Fichot & Benner 2011, Leech et al. 2016, Cook et al. 2017, Massicotte et al. 2017, Martin et al. 2018). Thus, increases in tDOC flux to coastal waters will necessarily entail increases in terrigenous CDOM flux. Moreover, tDOC and the associated terrigenous CDOM frequently exhibit relatively conservative mixing behaviour across salinity gradients in estuaries and shelf seas (Blough et al. 1993, Yamashita et al. 2011, Fichot & Benner 2012, Chen et al. 2015, Martin et al. 2018, Painter et al. 2018), such that shelf seas and adjacent oceanic regions can have high concentrations of tDOC and terrigenous CDOM (Blough et al. 1993, Kaiser et al. 2017, Medeiros et al. 2017, Carr et al. 2019, Zhou et al. 2019).

However, CDOM in coastal waters often consists of a mixture of marine and terrigenous CDOM in proportions that can vary strongly spatially and temporally. The most common way to distinguish marine from terrigenous CDOM is by measuring the slope of the CDOM absorption spectrum, originally over large wavelength ranges from UV to visible (Stedmon & Markager 2001, Kowalczuk et al. 2006, Astoreca et al. 2009). More recently, spectral slopes over narrow ranges of shorter wavelengths have become increasingly established for identifying terrigenous CDOM in terrestrially influenced marine waters, especially the spectral slope between 275\u2013295 nm, S275\u2013295 (Helms et al. 2008, Vantrepotte et al. 2015, Lu et al. 2016, Medeiros et al. 2017, Carr et al. 2019, Signorini et al. 2019).

Consequently, although large-scale anthropogenic changes in land\u2013ocean tDOC fluxes have the potential to alter the light environment of shelf seas by altering the terrigenous CDOM concentration, our knowledge of such impacts is still very limited. Based on long-term trends in salinity and correlations between salinity and CDOM in Norwegian fjords, Aksnes et al. (2009) inferred that increased terrigenous CDOM had resulted in \u201ccoastal browning\u201d, which may have contributed to mesopelagic regime shifts from fish (visual predators) to jellyfish (tactile predators). Similarly, an increase in non-autotrophic particulate organic carbon in southern Norway was interpreted as indicating an increase in terrigenous CDOM, and this was hypothesised to have contributed to the collapse of coastal kelp forests (Frigstad et al. 2013). An increase in terrigenous CDOM was also invoked as a possible mechanism driving decreased water clarity in the North Sea (Dupont & Aksnes 2013), which may have caused a shift in the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom by up to three weeks (Opdal et al. 2019). Ecosystem modelling has additionally demonstrated that increased terrigenous CDOM absorption can lead to a shallower distribution of phytoplankton and a shallower nutricline, resembling symptoms of eutrophication (Urtizberea et al. 2013). Moreover, recent time series of CDOM and comparison to historical chromaticity measurements suggest that terrigenous CDOM concentrations in the Gulf of Maine have increased as a result of greater river run-off (Balch et al. 2012, Balch et al. 2016), although the impacts for light attenuation could not be quantified in these studies.

Although these systems do show many ecological similarities, e.g., in species composition (Eyal et al. 2016, Chow et al. 2019, Laverick et al. 2020), the spectral distribution of the available light in Singapore is clearly very different compared to deep mesophotic ecosystems that receive mostly blue wavelengths (Kahng et al. 2019). Whether such differences in spectral light quality, and the additional seasonal changes we report here, are physiologically and ecologically significant for coral reefs is unclear. Corals can clearly acclimate to low light intensities both in deep and shallow mesophotic conditions (see review by Kahng et al. (2019)), such as by altering their skeletal morphology to minimise self-shading (Todd 2008, Ow & Todd 2010), and by enhancing light scattering by the skeleton and light absorption within the tissue layer (Polinski & Voss 2018, Kramer et al. 2020). However, the spectral light quality does appear to affect coral physiology. For example, calcification rates of two coral species were substantially increased under blue light compared to other wavelengths for equal light intensities (Cohen et al. 2016), and blue light acclimation increased maximum photosynthetic rates in Montipora verrucosa relative to green and red light (Kinzie & Hunter 1987). Branches of Stylophora pistillata acclimated to either blue or full-spectrum light showed better photosynthetic performance under the spectral conditions they were acclimated to (Mass et al. 2010). Blue light also controls the fluorescent pigmentation of several coral taxa (D\u2019Angelo et al. 2008), while red light was found to reduce the health and survival of Stylophora pistillata (Wijgerde et al. 2014). Whether fluorescent proteins play a photo-physiological role in enabling coral acclimation to low-intensity blue light is still debated (D\u2019Angelo et al. 2008, Roth et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2017, Kahng et al. 2019). However, the presence of photoconvertible red fluorescent proteins was necessary for long-term survival of two coral species under low-intensity blue light (Smith et al. 2017).

This approach has been successful in introducing disease resistance as well as drought and heat adaptive traits (Cossani and Reynolds, 2015; Lopes ; Lopes and Reynolds, 2011; Reynolds ; Trethowan and Mujeeb-Kazi, 2008)). Despite the range of genetic resources available, the vast majority of genetic resources remain unused in breeding (Reynolds, Foulkes, ) because of uncertainties associated with the use of undomesticated or unimproved genetic backgrounds. Landrace and synthetic material have been identified with superior biomass in comparison with elite lines under drought and heat conditions (Cossani and Reynolds, 2015; Lopes and Reynolds, 2011) and elite lines that include landrace or synthetic material in their background have been developed in recent years for heat and yield potential conditions (Reynolds ).

The conversion of light into chemical energy is achieved by the absorption of photons by pigments in light-harvesting complexes followed by the transfer of that energy to the reaction center, where it is used to initiate the electron transfer and charge separation processes. Plastoquinones mediate the transfer of electrons between photosystem II (PSII), the cytochrome b6f complex (Cytb6f), and photosystem I (PSI). The net result is the generation of ATP and NADPH, which are then used for carbon fixation, biosynthesis, and aerobic respiration (see review by Eberhard et al. [1]).

Pigment molecules thus play key roles in the acclimation (short-term) and adaptation (long-term) of phytoplankton to the variability in light. In addition to their physiological importance, evolutionary divergence has led to the formation of a variety of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments in different photosynthetic organisms, which allows us to delineate activity amongst phytoplankton groups [e.g., 3]. Also, the biosynthetic pathways of pigments are well known [e.g., 4].

Little is known about the synchronicity of photosynthetic metabolic pathways between different phytoplankton groups in nutrient deplete marine environments such as the subtropical gyres. Yet, the nutrient scarcity requires niche and/or resource partitioning by different phytoplankton to facilitate growth in the face of competition [11]. Additionally, temporal anomalies of phytoplankton biomass and cellular pigment content impact the optical properties of the surface ocean influencing the interpretation of satellite-derived ocean color observations and global models using these data [12]. In these studies, diel oscillations are typically not considered because satellite observations take place only at a narrow interval of the diurnal cycle. Instead, most global ocean ecosystem models based on satellite data assume that the observed phytoplankton communities are under steady state growth conditions with respect to daily time-scales [e.g., 13].

This pattern is distinct from previous investigations of diurnal Chl, which showed a mid-day maximum and a night-time minimum especially in data integrated through the water column [10, 20, 21]. Based on these previous observations, it was thought that Chl synthesis directly reflects primary production by photoadaptation, with increasing cellular chlorophyll during the day and chlorophyll break down (or dilution by cell division) at night [e.g., 22]. Alternatively, mid-day minima in surface water Chl that have frequently been observed in data from in vivo Chl fluorescence have been interpreted to result from non-photochemical quenching, not absolute decreases in Chl concentrations. The reasoning behind this interpretation is that variability in quantum yield for fluorescence is significant and complicates the interpretation of Chl estimates from in vivo fluorescence at high light intensities (e.g., [23\u201325]). However, here we used mass spectrometry to determine Chl concentrations from lipid extracts, which is insensitive to quenching.

All showed similar trends, with a nocturnal increase leading to a pre-dawn maximum and a minimum later, during daylight hours (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2). Similar to Chls, the nocturnal increase may seem counterintuitive as light harvesting molecules are needed during the day for photosynthesis. However, at high photon flux, the rate of photon absorption by Chl antenna far exceeds the rate at which photons can be utilized for photosynthesis; to avoid over-excitation of the photosystem, high light acclimation typically involves downsizing of the antenna of both photosystems [34, 35], in particular of PSII [36].

Increased vertical mixing during the night could also explain this signal, but the surface mixed layer typically ranges from \u223c0-40 m [37], which is too shallow to transport large amounts of Chl, for example, from the deep Chl maximum (at \u223c100 m at station ALOHA our sampling site and times [15, see Fig. 1 therein]) to the sampling depth of 15 m. Additionally, Prochlorococcus cell numbers remained constant over the diel cycle in our samples, which results in increasing divinyl-Chl/cell quotas during the night (Fig. S2) and supports the hypothesis of night-time synthesis. The energy and carbon for the de novo synthesis of Chls in the dark is likely provided by carbon stores, for example glycogen in cyanobacteria or triacylglycerols (TAGs) in eukaryotic phytoplankton. Consistent with this, we recently showed that nanoeukaryotic phytoplankton in the NPSG accumulate large amounts of TAGs during the day and subsequently consume them at night [38].

Most notably, pheophytin has been found to play an important role in electron transport in PSII by being the primary electron acceptor for excited Chl [47] and has been frequently detected in isolated PSII with a 6:2 stoichiometry of Chl and pheophytin [e.g., 48]. Additionally, pheophytin and Chl share a biochemical pathway, where Chl is converted to pheophytin by a magnesium dechelatase [49] supporting the idea of simultaneous dark synthesis of Chls and pheophytins. Other Chl related structures, pheophorbide and chlorophyllide, were out of phase with Chl and pheophytin, both showing peak times at 14:00 h (Fig. 2).

Diadinoxanthin (Dd) and diatoxanthin (Dt), which are part of the Dd/Dt xanthophyll cycle predominantly possessed by haptophytes, diatoms and dinoflagellates in the NPSG [51], were the most abundant xanthophyll cycle pigments detected (Fig. S1). The sum of Dt and Dd showed clear diel cycles with maximum abundances during the day (peak time at 14:00 h; Fig. 2). This pattern indicates that the cellular xanthophyll pigment pool increased during daylight hours likely due to photoadaptation triggered by a change of light intensity over the course of the day [32]. The de-epoxidation state (DES), which is defined as [Dt]/[Dt+Dd], showed a minimum during the day (Fig. S2), which contrasts observations from culture experiments [52] and the field [32]. This pattern is likely related to severe high-light stress at 15 m water depth where our samples were collected. Oxidative stress due to an increased formation of various ROS species consumes Dt by degrading it to low molecular weight compounds [53, 54], requiring re-synthesis for the pool to be refilled. Potentially, phytoplankton refill cellular Dt stores during the night. We therefore looked for Violaxanthin de-epoxidases, which convert Dd to Dt in the xanthophyll cycle [55], and find that transcript abundances for the diatoms and haptophytes were out of phase with XCPs (Fig. S10). Additionally, Zeaxanthin epoxidases, which participate in non-photochemical quenching by regulating the level of epoxy-free xanthophylls in photosynthetic energy conversion, showed statistically significant diel oscillation for diatoms and haptophytes with peak times during the day at 10:00 h local time (Fig. S11). Our results from the pigment analysis thus show that high light conditions in the upper photic zone results in severe photooxidative stress for phytoplankton, which is displayed in a distinct and different diel xanthophyll cycle pigment and Chl degradation product patterns compared to observations from the deeper photic zone [32]. Through this, phytoplankton are likely able to maintain the balance between dissipation and utilization of light energy to minimize the generation of ROS and resulting molecular damage. Since net primary production is typically invariable throughout the mixed layer at station ALOHA [56], the observed pigment signal represents a light adaptation signal as opposed to an increased photodegradation state of near surface phytoplankton cells.", "figure_ref": ["fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "8ac37378-f0a6-49ab-b64d-d61da04ece09": {"text": "Analyses of quinones in the marine water column are still relatively rare [38, 57, 58], but due to their physiological importance in electron transport in both photosynthesis and cellular respiration, quinones provide valuable information on microbial activities. While plastoquinones (PQs) are primarily involved in electron transport of PSII, ubiquinones (UQs) are associated with aerobic respiration [59]. Recent studies suggested PQs and UQs might additionally be involved in photoprotective mechanisms by acting as ROS scavengers [60\u201363]. In our samples, both quinone groups showed distinct and statistically significant diel patterns (Fig. 2; Table S1) with UQs peaking at the end of the night (6:00 h; cf. [38]) and PQs peaking at the end of the day (18:00 h, Fig. 2). These two groups of structurally similar molecules were thus out of phase by 12 h. The pre-dawn maximum of UQs is likely associated with enhanced respiration of storage lipids, which have been shown to accumulate during the day and are consumed at night [38]. The daytime increase of PQs may partly be driven by growth, but similar to other photosystem constituents, photoacclimation mechanisms play a major role for intercellular PQ abundances. Increasing the rates of electron transport processes can protect PSII when absorption of quanta exceeds the requirements of photosynthetic carbon metabolism [64], which, in turn, requires an increase in the PQ pool size and may in part be responsible for observed daytime maxima of PQs. Additionally, in plants, PQs have been shown to act as ROS scavengers under high-light stress [65, 66]. These processes deplete PQs due to photooxidation during daylight hours. Hence, they have to be re-synthesized to keep this important function. The daytime increase in the proportion of the PQ to chlorophyll pool (Fig. S2) is likely due to the different organization of chloroplast structure. In plants, chloroplasts have less antenna chlorophyll per electron transport chain under high light than low light [67].", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "7e36c8eb-0f02-4ef8-b87e-c34c186f2e12": {"text": "In addition to measuring diel oscillations in pigments and quinones, we further explored diel transcriptional rhythms of genes involved in photosynthesis and pigment metabolism of the dominant bacterial and eukaryotic groups at station ALOHA.

Almost all significant diel transcripts associated with photosynthesis and pigment metabolism peaked in the first part of the day (10:00 h; Fig. 3a), suggesting their transcriptional regulation in phototrophs is strongly synchronized across diverse taxa (within the temporal resolution of our measurements).

Thus, our data is consistent with a multispecies synchronous diel cycles of genes associated with photosynthesis and pigment metabolism with increasing transcript abundances during dark hours and peak times in the mid-morning. Nightly expression of photosynthesis genes in natural photoheterotrophic bacteria, followed by a drawdown shortly after light onset, has been suggested to be related to preparing cells for efficient solar energy harvest in the early morning hours [6]. Our data from cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton and consistent with this hypothesis. A notable exception of this pattern was Crocosphaera. Transcripts for most pathways in this diazotroph only showed a weak relationship or no significant positive correlation with the pathways in the other phytoplankton populations. However, this is in agreement with other culture [68] and field-based observations [15, 69]. The process of N2 fixation in this unicellular cyanobacteria seems to require a tightly orchestrated diel cycle distinct from other diazotrophs and non-diazotrophic microorganisms [15, 69].", "figure_ref": ["fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "5389e07d-0bb2-42bd-b556-490032de6c94": {"text": "Relationship between periodic pigment-associated gene expression in phytoplankton transcripts and actual pigment abundances a.

However, peak times for pathways involved in photosynthesis and pigment metabolism seem to be variable in culture experiments. For example, light harvesting antenna protein gene expression was enriched in late afternoon (2 to 6 pm) for iron-replete cultures of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, along with genes involved in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism [71], while enrichment for the KEGG pathways photosynthesis and porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism was observed in the dawn for the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana [70]. This variability in the timing of gene expression contrasts our findings from natural phytoplankton populations in the NPSG, which showed synchronized expression patterns across diverse phytoplankton. This synchrony across taxa has recently also been shown for a coastal environment [8] and together the results indicate that responses to signals in the environment, possibly including organismal interactions, play an important role in shaping gene expression patterns of natural phytoplankton populations.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "35ab0587-6d68-489a-80d9-413d5ac7c923": {"text": "The combination of pigment analysis and metatranscriptomics further shed light on the complex interplay between metabolic pathways and actual metabolite concentrations. In a previous study of energy storage mechanisms of natural phytoplankton populations at station ALOHA, we showed that gene expression and lipid abundances were decoupled - despite distinct diel patterns in storage lipid abundance, transcript abundance for the genes involved in the final step of their biosynthesis remained relatively constant over the diel cycle [38; Fig 4]. In addition, the correlations we observe between transcripts and lipids (shown in Fig. 3b) are not significantly stronger than the correlations expected from comparing independent time series (see Fig. S13). In culture experiments with the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, during high light acclimation, Chl metabolism at the transcriptional level was down-regulated at an early stage while Chl a concentrations showed a lag time to this initial transcriptional response [73], which is what would be expected for an ideal system. However, the change of concentrations of pigments or any metabolite is governed by the difference between production and consumption. For example, the observed offset in peak time between transcripts (mid-morning) and associated pigments (dawn, Fig. 3a) suggests the influence of additional regulatory processes for chlorophyll and carotenoid pigment abundances. Irradiance at 15 m at station ALOHA (700 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) was higher than in the \u201chigh light\u201d experiments conducted by Nymark et al. [73] (500 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) and the different patterns between the culture experiments and our field based observations may be related to photoacclimation mechanisms. Our observations that transcripts peak approximately 4 hours later than their corresponding pigments might indicate that phytoplankton actively synthesize Chls and PSC at a high rate, but catabolic processes, i.e., a shift towards photoprotection, consume more molecules than are produced. Our data thus show that metatranscriptome data should not be interpreted as a real-time readout of photophysiological metabolism.", "figure_ref": ["fig4", "fig3", "fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "244cbbbc-09db-4052-b10d-73d86c8cc002": {"text": "Conceptualized temporal separation of phytoplankton pigment, plastoquinone and transcript abundances during the dark-light cycle in surface waters (15 m) at station ALOHA.

Kana et al. [74] proposed that pigment abundance is modulated by environmental factors extending beyond gene expression/regulation, i.e., the initial response to high light intensities is self-adjusting. The light sensor that in a first step regulates photoacclimation in phytoplankton has been suggested to be the redox state of the quinone pool [74]. Although our methods do not allow direct determination of the redox state of the PQ pool because plastoquinols become spontaneously oxidized to plastoquinones when exposed to oxygen during sample analysis, we found significant diel oscillations in the expression of Chl a/b binding protein (cab) genes (Fig. S12). The cab genes are important for both light-harvesting and photoprotection in eukaryotic phytoplankton and are under transcriptional control by the redox poise of the PQ pool [75]. In cultures, under high light, it has been shown that the PQ pool becomes more reduced resulting in a suppression of cab mRNA synthesis and light harvesting complex production, and an ultimate decrease in cellular photosynthetic pigments [75]. We observed a decline in cab transcript abundances during daylight hours (Fig. S12) suggesting that this light intensity-dependent photon-sensing system is active in the NPSG. This process then likely triggers the down-regulation of photosynthesis and pigment metabolism related genes to keep pigments levels consistently low to prevent over-excitation of the photosystems at the high irradiance levels phytoplankton experience in the surface waters of the NPSG. Besides the insights our data provided on the (de)coupling between transcriptional and metabolite rhythms, our data suggest that the night reflects a metabolic recovery phase that is used by all photosynthetic organisms across domains to be prepared for photosynthetic reaction as soon as the sun rises, make optimal use of sunlight energy and grow efficiently.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "b3b5beb3-dc44-4621-9cf5-c96804a96071": {"text": "We are just beginning to understand in detail the mechanisms by which marine phytoplankton are able to maintain homeostasis and coordinate growth under metabolic and energetic shifts driven by the perpetual rising and setting sun. Our work demonstrates that combined lipidomics (here pigment and quinone profiles) and transcriptomics can provide mechanistic insights into rapid (i.e., sub-daily) microbial processes (Fig. 4). While pigments involved in light harvesting and energy transfer peaked at dawn, photoprotective pigments and Chl degradation products peaked later in the day. This succession of pigment metabolism according to their function suggests a recovery of cellular Chl and PSC stores at night and a dominance of photoprotective mechanisms during daylight. The diel cycles of combined pigment, quinone and transcriptomics data from the NPSG thus highlight the fundamental connection between sunlight and phytoplankton photosynthetic metabolism [74]. Furthermore, diel metabolic cycles were similar across all major phytoplankton taxa with few exceptions. Thus, harvesting light energy is not the basis for temporal niche differentiation among these taxa, which stands to reason because photons are in excess at 15 m depth and therefore are not a resource that phytoplankton compete with one another to obtain. Niche differentiation among phytoplankton occurs for processes involving competitive and growth-limiting substrates, such as nutrients, which are scarce in the surface of the oligotrophic ocean. Yet the daily synthesis of pigments \u2013 and the machinery required for this synthesis \u2013 place considerable burden on phytoplankton for growth-limiting substrates. Thus, any temporal partitioning in accessing growth-limiting substrates must also be accompanied by different modes for their storage, which are rarely considered [77, 78]. In summary, the data presented herein advances our knowledge of this fundamental process within photosynthetic microbes in the mixed layer, providing valuable detailed observations of transcriptional and pigment dynamics across kingdoms.

While primary metabolism is universal, secondary metabolism is often unique to specific plant families. Metabolites are small molecules that facilitate metabolic processes. Primary metabolites like amino acids, sugars, organic acids and others involved in processes such as photosynthesis, respiration etc. (Fang et al., 2019) Metabolites like alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, anthocyanins, coumarins and others support secondary metabolism leading to an array of phytochemicals that play specific roles like protection under stress. Among these the phenolics, confer chemical-biological roles supporting growth, development and protection under stress (Bueno et al., 2012)(Singh et al., 2021). Accumulation of phenolics is spatial, temporal and stimuli regulated and can be specific to tissue types, species, and developmental stages (Barros et al., 2012)(Lingwan et al., 2020). The analysis of phenolics is essential to understand the adaptation mechanisms in plants. The plant phenolics can broadly be classified into polyphenols (lignin, tannins), oligophenols (coumarins, stilbenes, flavonoids) and monophenols. The chemical structure of phenolic compounds has a phenolic ring with one or more hydroxyl groups, which are reported to promote plant defence, enhance antioxidants by scavenging free radicals.

Melanocytes ensure photo-protection of the skin by producing the pigment melanin and transferring it to neighbouring cells [1]. The interaction of melanocytes with surrounding keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, is vital to induce melanocyte differentiation and to trigger melanogenesis and tanning [2,3]. Altered melanocyte functions can cause hypo- and hyperpigmentation disorders [4] as well as malignant melanoma, a highly lethal skin cancer [1] Similar to cells of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes originate from neural crest cells. Following gradual lineage specification, melanocyte precursors, so-called melanoblasts, migrate through the developing embryo along distinct yet incompletely understood paths [5]. In mice, upon crossing of the dermal-epidermal junction, melanoblasts home to the growing hair follicle or, in non-hairy skin, to the basal layer of the epidermis [4,7]. Follicular and interfollicular melanocytes coexist in the back skin epidermis during the first postnatal days. With onset of the postnatal hair follicle cycle [9], or following diverse stress signals [11,13,15], quiescent melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) are activated to provide mature, pigment-producing melanocytes. Ultimately, differentiated melanocytes assume intriguingly branched and polarized cell shapes, and possess a unique vesicular machinery for the polarized peripheral transport and concomitant maturation of melanosomes [6]. The mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal control of melanocyte shape and plasticity, however, remain poorly understood.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "b7386110-425f-43ef-b840-3523f97cd2fe": {"text": "Melanin production is tightly coupled to the melanocyte differentiation program. Onset of differentiation and pigmentation is marked by the activation of various pathways leading mostly to the induction of the microphthalinia-associateA transcription factor MITF [8]. MITF in turn drives the transcription of melanin synthesis related genes such as Tyip1, Tyrp2, Tyr [10] and other genes important for differentiation and survival like cKit [12,14,16]. Next to Notch, Wnt, endothelin and TGF\u00df signaling [17\u201322], two main pathways have been reported to control the induction of MITF: the \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH)/ melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1R) signaling pathway, and the Stem Cell Factor (SCF)/cKit receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. As an acute physiological response to UV radiation, keratinocytes produce and secrete \u03b1-MSH, which (similar to adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) can bind to Mc1R, initiating an intracellular, cAMP-mediated signaling cascade in melanocytes. Activated protein kinase A (PKA) in turn phosphorylates the cAMP-responsive-element-binding protein (CREB) [23], resulting in transcriptional activation of MITF, thereby driving skin pigmentation [8,24,25].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "9e734d19-2f3f-40d1-b7f4-d8d68463e216": {"text": "We and others previously demonstrated that in keratinocytes the apical polarity proteins Par3 and aPKC\u03bb regulate cell-cell adhesion [26], stem cell fate, spindle orientation and differentiation in the epidermis [27\u201330]. In the adult skin epithelium, Par3 and aPKC\u03bb promote balanced fate decisions and protect against premature epidermal differentiation, though likely through independent mechanisms [27,29,31,32]. While above work unravelled an emerging epithelial-intrinsic role of polarity proteins, we recently also uncovered extrinsic functions of polarity proteins in the control of neighbouring melanocytes: Disturbed polarity signalling in the surrounding skin epithelium resulted in aberrant keratinocyte-melanocyte adhesions, promoting melanocyte transformation and malignant progression in a melanoma mouse model [33]. Whether and how \u2018apical\u2019 polarity networks also act cell-autonomously within non-epithelial skin resident cell types is currently not known. Prompted by previous reports of polarity signalling in different neuronal processes, such as axon specification [34,35], dendritic branching [36\u201339], spine morphogenesis [40,41], and polarized vesicular transport [42], we here set out to investigate the significance of intrinsic polarity proteins for melanocyte function and mammalian skin pigmentation.

Interestingly, knock-down of either Par3 or aPKC\u03bb+\u03b6 led to hypopigmented melanocytes that exhibited significantly reduced melanin levels compared to control melanocytes (Fig. 1A-C), indicating that different apical polarity proteins regulate melanocyte pigmentation. To decipher how loss of polarity signaling interferes with melanocyte function in vivo, we subsequently inactivated Par3 in the melanocyte lineage employing tyrosinase promoter-driven expression of Cre recombinase (Tyr-Cre [43]) combined with a conditional Par3fl/fl allele [44,45] (Fig. S1A). Strong reduction of Par3 mRNA and protein levels was confirmed in primary melanocytes isolated from TyrCre;Par3fl/fl (Par3MCKO) mice (Fig. S1A-C). Previous reports of melanocyte-restricted inactivation of cytoskeletal regulators like Rac1 and Cdc42 showed pigmentation defects in the coat colour (i.e. ventral patches of hypopigmented hair) due to a failure of melanoblasts to fully populate the skin in developing embryos [46,47]. Notably, at birth, Par3MCKO mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from control littermates (Fig. S1D) and displayed a normal hair coat up to 12 months of age (Fig. S1E). This suggested that migration of melanoblast and hair coloration did not require Par3. Interestingly, however, Par3MCKO mice showed hypopigmentation of the anterior tail skin as assessed by macroscopic analysis (Fig. 1E) and quantification of melanin content in these tissues (Fig. 1F, G). In murine tail skin-contrary to back skin-melanocytes reside not only in the hair follicles but also in distinct domains (\u201cscales\u201d) within the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) [48], closely resembling human skin. Melanocytes are also present in deeper dermal layers, posing the question of which melanocyte pool was responsible for the hypopigmentation in Par3MCKO mice. Importantly, whereas melanin levels in the dermis of Par3MCKO mice were unaltered, we found specifically the epidermal pigmentation to be reduced upon Par3 deletion (Fig. 1G).

Analyses of Par3MCKO melanocytes in the tail epidermis did not reveal differences in dendricity though; with on average three major dendrites per cell in both control and Par3-deficient melanocytes (Fig. S2B). Notably, however, both the mean cell area and the main axis length of melanocytes in tail epidermis scales were decreased in Par3MCKO mice (Fig. 2A, B), indicating reduced dendritic outgrowth and hence potentially reduced differentiation of Par3MCKO scale melanocytes compared to controls. Thus far no reliable tools for endogenous markers have been established that could serve to label the stem cell pool. Instead, McSCs are typically characterized by their shape and lack of melanin, in addition to low expression of MITF and cKit [12]. Interestingly, next to their altered morphology, Par3MCKO melanocytes in the tail scale exhibited a reduced immunoreactivity for cKit (Fig. 2C, D), supporting the concept of Par3MCKO melanocytes residing in a less differentiated state compared to control melanocytes. These results were also interesting in light of recent data by us and others obtained in keratinocytes, where Par3 complex proteins serve to maintain stemness features of epithelial cells [27,29\u201331].

We therefore asked whether Par3 was also required for pigmentation of the developing epidermis in neo- and early postnatal back skin, considering its resemblance to IFE scales with respect to resident intra-epidermal melanocytes (Fig. 2E). Similar to adult tail epidermis, the pigmentation of Par3MCKO epidermis was reduced at P0 and P2 when compared to control littermates (Fig. 2F). Similarly, the cKit immunoreactivity of back skin melanocytes in two-day old Par3MCKO mice was lower than in controls, indicative of reduced differentiation of IFE melanocytes (Fig. 2G, H). At P5 we did not anymore detect an overt pigmentation of back skin epidermis in control and Par3MCKO mice (Fig. S2D), in line with the developmental decline in IFE melanocytes at this stage (Fig. 2E) [49]. Moreover, no aberrant pigmentation of the dermal compartments in Par3MCKO mice was seen at any of these stages (Fig. S2D), congruent with our observation in the dermis of adult tail skin and thus emphasizing the requirement of Par3 for melanocytes residing in close vicinity to IFE epithelial cells. The reduced cKit mean fluorescence intensity of epidermal Par3MCKO melanocytes was further confirmed by FACS analysis of epidermis from adult tail skin and P2 back skin (Fig. S2E). We were intrigued by this distinct requirement of Par3 for the pigmentation of the IFE. Though mammalian skin epidermis and the hair follicle represent a continuous tissue, the structural and functional properties and tasks of the barrier-forming IFE and the cycling hair follicle \u201cmini-organ\u201d [50,51] differ significantly. For example, cells are exposed to different environmental cues dependent on their niche. UV-B radiation e.g. mainly affects cells of the IFE, whereas pathogens mainly enter the skin through hair follicles [52]. Kasper and colleagues [53] reported spatial expression signatures of the murine IFE and follicular epithelium. Of note, a recent single cell expression profiling study extended this view to distinct signatures of human IFE vs. follicular melanocytes [54], thereby confirming the previously proposed melanocyte heterogeneity [55,56]. Albeit the exact underlying mechanisms remain open, it seems likely that local parameters within the IFE, and potentially distinct keratinocyte-melanocyte interactions in that niche, contribute to the observed Par3-dependent melanogenesis.", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "e2a0c0d7-5e7b-4ef3-b4be-248ca08e2b8f": {"text": "To investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the hypopigmentation in epidermal tissue of Par3MCKO mice, we isolated primary melanocytes from the back skin of P2 Par3MCKO mice and cultured them in vitro.

Moreover, nuclear immunoreactivity for the transcription factor MITF was significantly decreased in Par3KO melanocytes (Fig. 3H, I).

SIK antagonizes MITF transcription by phosphorylating CRTC, thereby preventing its nuclear translocation and as consequence the activation of CREB [61]. PKA instead is a positive regulator of MITF, counteracting SIK function. SIK inhibition by HG 9-91-01 has recently been reported as a UV-independent approach to induce MITF-driven skin pigmentation [62]. Intriguingly, SIK inhibitor treatment of primary Par3KO melanocytes was sufficient to restore Tyrp1 expression (Fig. 4C) and melanin content to the level of control melanocytes (Fig. 4D, E). Strikingly, next to this reinstalled pigmentation of Par3-deficient melanocytes in vitro, SIK inhibition also rescued the hypopigmentation of Par3MCKO explants (Fig. 4F, G, H). Differential melanin content analysis revealed that this was due to a significant increase of melanin in the epidermal compartment (Fig. 4G, H), whereas pigmentation of the corresponding dermal explant fraction was unaltered (Fig. S4B). In line with the restored epidermal melanin levels, Tyrp1 expression in the epidermal fraction of SIK inhibitor-treated Par3MCKO skin was significantly elevated and comparable to that of control epidermis (Fig. 4I). These results thus suggest that Par3 promotes epidermal melanocyte pigmentation and differentiation through steering of MITF function.

It is also uncertain just how important are the native properties of the plastids themselves in terms of facilitating their survival for weeks and months inside animal cytosol in isolation from the algal nucleus. The slugs are only able to retain plastids that come from specific algae species (Christa ; de Vries ), but to what extent this is due to the general robustness of plastids of these algae (Giles & Sarafis, 1972; Trench ; 1973b; Green ) or their specific genetic and photosynthetic properties (de Vries ; Christa ; Havurinne ) remains to be fully tested.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "0551535b-a3f9-412d-9f24-eb50a9dbfe97": {"text": "Irreversible light-induced damage to Photosystem II (PSII) of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, termed photoinhibition, is an important reason why survival of plastids in isolation within slug cells for months requires special mechanisms.

Even though the exact mechanism(s) of photoinhibition remain elusive, decades of work on the topic have revealed several \u201crules\u201d that most photosynthetic organisms comply to.

In spite of photoinhibition, photosynthetic organisms maintain high photosynthetic activity by continuously repairing damaged PSII reaction centers (J\u00e4rvi ).

On the other hand, much effort has been invested into evaluating the physiological photoprotection mechanisms of the plastids. It has been shown that the plastids in the slugs maintain similar or slightly elevated photoprotective non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanisms as the plastids in the algae, at least in recently fed slugs (Cruz ; Christa ; Cartaxana ; Havurinne & Tyystj\u00e4rvi, 2020).

Such suppression (apparent enrichment of 750 nm emission) effect can be the result of a higher local concentration of photosynthetic material in E. timida in comparison to Acetabularia. High local concentration of chlorophyll causes strong self-absorption of fluorescence emission at 685 nm, but not at 750 nm (Lichtenthaler ; Weis, 1985). Self-absorption also depends on the penetration depth of the excitation light: the deeper the excitation occurs, the higher is the probability of re-absorption of the fluorescence photon on its way out.

The reflectance spectra of freshly fed E. timida individuals and Acetabularia cells resembled each other, as both reflected far red light (>700 nm) and showed low reflectance in the red and blue regions due to absorption of light by Chl. Reflectance in the green region was higher than in red or blue but lower than in far red, as expected for photosynthetic material (Virtanen ). Intriguingly, the red edge of reflectance (the increase in reflectance at around 700 nm) in freshly fed slugs appeared to be shifted to longer wavelengths compared to Acetabularia (Fig. 4A). The optical properties of E. timida changed when the slugs were kept in starvation for 9 and 21 days, or until the slugs were nearly completely bleached, as shown by the reflectance spectra measured from these individuals (Fig. 4A).

Firstly, E. timida exhibited a strong suppression of 685 nm fluorescence due to self-absorption compared to Acetabularia in the tested excitation wavelength range (Fig. 3). Reflectance and absorptance spectra provide a second piece of evidence for tight packing of plastids within the slugs, as the red edge of reflectance and the red absorption peak of Chl a in freshly fed E. timida are shifted in a manner that suggests that the slugs absorb longer wavelengths of red and far-red light than Acetabularia (Fig. 4A,B). The same phenomenon can be seen in senescing birch leaves, as green leaves absorb light at longer wavelengths than senescing ones (Mattila ). Furthermore, the red edge of the reflectance spectrum of E. timida moves toward shorter wavelengths when the slugs lose plastids during starvation (Fig. 4A). These data show that the position of the red edge of reflectance, and consequently also that of the red peak of absorptance, depend on the amount of green plastids per slug. Tight packing of slug plastids also explains why the slugs absorb much less light than the algae when the absorptance is normalized to the Chl content of the samples (Fig. 4C). It should be noted, however, that 30 slugs had to be packed in a test-tube to get a single absorptance reading, and therefore the packing of slugs may have further lowered the absorptance.

It is well known that for the energy of sunlight to be converted and stored into biological systems, it must first be captured by the pigments present in the photosynthetic organisms. All photosynthetic organisms synthesize two types of pigments: (a) bacteriochlorophylls and/or chlorophylls, which function in both light harvesting and photochemistry, and (b) carotenoids, which primarily act as photoprotective pigments but can also function in light harvesting. Notably, almost all necessary bacteriochlorophyll synthesis components widely distribute in Heimdallarchaeota MAGs, which provides sufficient evidence that Heimdallarchaeota could synthesize bacteriochlorophyll (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 3). Among the key enzymes synthesizing bacteriochlorophyll, protochlorophyllide reductase (Por) could catalyze the reaction of transition between divinyl protochlorophyllide and divinyl chlorophyllide a. By the phylogenetic analysis, most of Por homologs in our Heimdallarchaeota MAGs clustered in a single clade at the root of the tree (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 3). However, one Por homolog in H2.bin.2 was found to locate in a sister clade with typical photosynthetic organisms including Cyanobacteria, Algae and Streptophytina (Plants), and they further clustered with phototrophic bacteria containing Chlorobi, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria (Rhodospirillales and Chromatiales), revealing the potential Heimdallarchaeota-phototrophs affiliation. The bacteriochlorophyll synthase (BCS) is capable of synthesizing bacteriochlorophyll a by esterification of bacteriochlorophyllide with phytyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and it is also annotated as digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase (DGPS). We further phylogenetically analyzed the evolutionary relationship between BCS and DGPS, and the results showed that all archaeal DGPS located at the root, which separating from the clade containing BCS from phototrophic bacteria and chlorophyll synthase from photosynthetic organisms (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 3). And homologous proteins of BCS in our Heimdallarchaeota MAGs clustered a clade with the DGPS in Heimdallarchaeota LC2, which located at a position between DGPS and BCS branches (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, a previous reported functional bacteriochlorophyll synthase derived from the uncultured Crenarchaeota was found to cluster a branch with the DGPS from Heimdallarchaeota LC3, and this cluster displayed a close evolutionary relationship with those photosynthetic bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll synthase branches (Fig. 1c). Although the function of these putative bacteriochlorophyll associated proteins remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to speculate that Heimdallarchaeota have a bacteriochlorophyll producing capability. It is known that bacteriochlorophylls or chlorophylls exist in only photosynthetic organisms. The evidence of bacteriochlorophyll production in both Heimdallarchaeota and Crenarchaeota suggests that archaea should have played an important role in the molecular evolution of bacteriochlorophyll synthase, and raises the significant possibility that the origin of photosynthesis probably predates the divergence of bacteria and archaea.", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig1", "fig1", "fig1", "fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "c91ebc1f-abe1-4470-9212-76e34a345eb9": {"text": "Phylogenomic analysis of photosynthetic pigments biosynthesis in Heimdallarchaeota. a, Analysis of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis in different Heimdallarchaeota and other Asgard archaeal genomes. b, c, Phylogenetic analyses of protochlorophyllide reductase (Por) and bacteriochlorophyll synthetase (BCS).

We reconstructed the complete synthesis pathway of lycopene, a biologically important carotenoid, derived from acetyl-CoA according to the Heimdallarchaeota MAGs (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 3). It has been mentioned that chlorophylls in photosynthesis ineffectively absorbed much light in the 450-550 nm (blue-green light) region of the solar radiation spectrum, while the light within this range can be effectively absorbed by carotenoids. Moreover, carotenoids protect the organisms from photodamage by quenching both singlet or triplet states of bacteriochlorophylls under strong illumination and function as photosynthetic membrane stabilizers in chloroplasts.

Logically, in the primary steps of photosynthesis, solar photons are absorbed by special membrane-associated pigment-protein complexes (light-harvesting antennas) and the electronic excitations are efficiently transferred to a reaction center. The oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms have two photochemical reaction center complexes, PS I and PS II, that work together in a noncyclic electron transfer chain. As a crucial electron carrier in PS I, phylloquinone was believed to be synthesized in Heimdallarchaeota (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 4). It is known that phylloquinone and its related compound menaquinone shared the same synthesis route for producing demethylphylloquinol, which is further catalyzed to phylloquinone or menaquinone by a key enzyme named demethylphylloquinol methyltransferase (MenG) or demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase (UbiE). MenG is responsible for phylloquinone (vitamin K1) synthesis in both plants and Cyanobacteria, and UbiE is only in charge of menaquinone (vitamin K2) synthesis in microorganism. Interestingly, both MenG and UbiE homologs were identified in Heimdallarchaeota MAGs (Supplementary Table 4). Consistently, in the phylogenetic tree, MenGs from photosynthetic organisms were clustered in a single branch which made a long distance from UbiE branches. While some MenG and UbiE homologs from plants, archaea together with Heimdallarchaeota were located exactly between these two branches (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 4).

Then electrons are carried by phylloquinone and transferred to Fe4-S4 cluster to generate NADH with electrons from ferredoxin in PSI.

For autotrophic metabolism, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was found to participate in carbon fixation through the RuBisCo and act as an intermediary between photosystems and ATP synthase for energy producing in Heimdallarchaeota (Fig. 4).

Consistent with the results of previous studies, the complete tricarboxylic-acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation pathway were found to support the aerobic respiration in Heimdallarchaeota. And both the aerobic kynurenine pathway and aspartate pathway for NAD+ de novo synthesis were also reconstructed in the present and previous published Heimdallarchaeota. Particularly, the aerobic kynurenine pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis was exclusively found in Heimdallarchaeota compared with other archaea, which is only present in eukaryotes and very few bacterial groups. This pathway has been considered to originate from the protoeukaryote ancestor in oxygen-containing niche, which might be acquired through horizontal gene transfer in Heimdallarchaeota. In addition, other molecules in oxygen-dependent metabolism, such as aerotaxis receptor and bacterioferritin, were also identified in Heimdallarchaeota MAGs. All the above evidence indicates that oxygen must be present in the environment where Heimdallarchaeota inhabit. But this seems to contradict the strict anaerobic lifestyle existing in other Asgard archaea like Thorarchaeota and Lokiarchaeota in the same niche. Therefore, we infer a more possible hypothesis that the oxygen presenting intracellular environment of Heimdallarchaeota might be generated by their performing photosynthesis. Consistently, Heimdallarchaeota have already evolved protection mechanisms against the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via superoxide dismutase, catalase, and carotenoids (Fig. 4). Together, the metabolic reconstructions indicate that Heimdallarchaeota are photomixotrophic and have a facultative aerobic metabolism. If this is the fact, what is the ecological function or benefit for having the ability of photosynthesis in Heimdallarhaeota, which reside predominantly in marine sediments? Recent study about rhodopsins identified in Heimdallarchaeota provides evidence of their light-exposed habitats, where Heimdallarchaeota could obtain enough energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. The recovery of Heimdallarchaeota from deeper environments may be due to the high deposition rates characteristic for the sampling locations. Nevertheless, there are plenty evidence showing that blue-green light with a wavelength range of 450-550 nm might exist in cold seep environment (~1100 m deep), and both long wavelength light (>650 nm) and (short wavelength light (<650 nm) could be detected in hydrothermal vents, which provides necessary condition for photosynthetic process. The Heimdallarchaeota capable of detecting geothermal light and phototaxis could preferentially occupy an optimum habitat, which confer them evolutionary advantages in the competition for nutrient resources. Accordingly, a kind of cyanobacterium collects light and passes excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active pigments through longer-wavelength chlorophyll f, which facilitates this bacterium to survive in dark condition. Thus, we suppose that possessing a presumptive photomixotrophic lifestyle may give Heimdallarchaeota more flexibility to survive or adapt to the deep-sea harsh conditions.", "figure_ref": ["fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "96ac6596-fca3-40dc-9f83-4064784be24a": {"text": "Notably, given the close match of the emission spectra of geothermal light and the absorption spectra of bacteriochlorophylls a and b, photosynthesis was proposed to arise from bacteriochlorophyll a- or b-containing organisms near oceanic hydrothermal vents where weak infrared radiation could be detected. In the evolution history of photosynthesis, the organisms were thought to initially use the bacteriochlorophyll pigments to sense infrared light, and started making use of the near-infrared part of sunlight when moving to shallow water through further adaptation of a primitive photosystem, and chlorophylls would be eventually developed to make use of higher energy (visible) light to split water. Meanwhile, during the evolution process of oxygenic photosynthesis, a bioinorganic water-oxidizing complex (WOC) was thought to serves as a redox capacitor to accomplish the oxidation of two water molecules to produce O2 in PS II, which is comprised with a Mn3CaO4 distorted cubane structure bound to a fourth Mn by oxo-bridges. And photoassembly of the WOC requires only Mn2+ and light to form the high-valent WOC. Interestingly, an extremely high concentration of manganese element was detected in our sampling hydrothermal vent (Extended Data Fig. 2), which might promote WOC formation and play a key role in the acquiring and developing of photosynthesis in Heimdallarchaeota. Consistently, Heimdallarchaeota MAGs H2.bin.2 and H2.bin.81 derived from hydrothermal vent possess much more photosynthetic characteristics than those from cold seep in our present work. Therefore, in combination with the facts that Heimdallarchaeota are the most probable candidates for the archaeal protoeukaryote ancestor in previous report and the first identified photosynthetic archaea in this study, we propose that Heimdallarchaeota might be ancestor of eukaryotic photosynthetic organism.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "3c95fa26-f754-4ae8-a57e-e267f3e57eff": {"text": "The presence of oxygen-dependent pathways in Heimdallarchaea raises the possibility that the archaeal eukaryotic phtosynthetic ancestor could have also been a facultative aerobe, and the archaeal-photobacterial endosymbiosist gave birth to the eukaryotic phtosynthetic ancestor took place after the Great Oxidation Event. Horizontal gene transfer is postulated to play a major role in the evolution of microbial phototrophs and that many of the essential components of photosynthesis have conducted horizontal gene transfer. And Heimdallarchaea might obtain the photosynthetic apparatus through lateral gene transfer from their cyanobacterial endosymbionts because most of key factors associated with photosynthesis in Heimdallarchaea have high similarity with those from cyanobacteria (Supplementary Table 5). Our prediction is in agreement with the recent hypothesis that both the archaeal and bacterial eukaryotic ancestors have an oxygen-dependent metabolism, in which the primordial function of the bacterial counterpart performing oxidative phosphorylation would not be detrimental to the existence of the archaeal host who exposed in oxygen environment.

Photosynthesis can be inhibited by either an inadequate pool of ATP or an imbalance between the quantity of ATP and NADPH present (Avenson et al., 2005b; Cruz et al., 2005; Amthor, 2010). Adjustments of ATP in chloroplasts through CET pathway results in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of Photosystem II (PSII), resulting in a significant loss in the fixation of CO2 (Long et al., 1994, Werner et al., 2001, Zhu et al., 2004). Fine tuning of NPQ in tobacco has enabled an enhanced level of photosynthetic efficiency to be attained, leading to a measurable increase in biomass yield (Kromdijk et al., 2016). One of the consequences of reducing photosynthetic efficiency is the accumulation of surplus electrons in the photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC), which promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since the functioning of both PSI and PSII is compromised by the presence of ROS (Miyake, 2010), the result is a diminution in the plant\u2019s capacity to assimilate CO2 (Zivcak et al., 2015a,b; Takagi et al., 2016). According to Gollan et al. (2017), the inhibition of PSI experienced by the Arabidopsis thaliana pgr5 mutant when exposed to a high light intensity limits both the light and dark reactions associated with photosynthesis, as well as chloroplast signaling and nuclear gene expression. Thus, avoiding PSI electron acceptor limitation or introducing additional electron dissipating pathways into the chloroplast have the potential to improve photosynthetic efficiency and hence increase the plant\u2019s productivity.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "d0dd29eb-b1a1-43f2-81ab-c585a0deeb74": {"text": "Algae, cyanobacteria, non-vascular plants (mosses and liverworts) and gymnosperms have evolved an alternative electron flow (AEF) pathway, driven by the so-called flavodiirons (Flvs). Analysis of the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 has identified the presence of four Flv genes. Their products, in the form of the heterodimers Flv1/Flv3 and Flv2/Flv4 drive oxygen-dependent electron flow under low levels of CO2 availability and fluctuating light conditions (Zhang et al., 2012; Allahverdiyeva et al., 2013; Hayashi et al., 2014; Shimakawa et al., 2015). The Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer generates an electron sink downstream of PSI and directs the electron flow to reduce O2 to H2O, thereby protecting PSI (Allahverdiyeva et al., 2013). Cyanobacterial Flv3 can also form a functional homodimer, which in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii acts in conjunction with ferredoxin 9 to transfer electrons into a glutathione-cysteine peroxidase pathway (Cassier-Chauvat et al., 2014). According to Yamamoto et al. (2016), inducing the expression of the Physcomitrella patens Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer in the A. thaliana pgr5 mutant provides partial compensation for the impairment of the cyclic electron transport pathway, an observation which demonstrates that Flvs can be functionally beneficial in an angiosperm.

The joint expression Flv1 and Flv3 isolated from a moss species in either the rice mutants pgr5 or NDH has been shown to rescue biomass accumulation (Wada et al., 2017).

Furthermore, plants harboring Flv1/Flv3 exhibited an improved performance with respect to \u03d5PSII, qL (Figure 3b,c) and NPQ (Figure 4a,c); these outcomes imply that the transgenic plants were capable to enhancing the flow of electrons from PSII to PSI, as well as having an improved capacity to dissipate electron pressure in the PETC during the dark-to-light transition, and the ability to activate protective non-photochemical quenching. The implication is that Flvs can act as regulators of photosynthesis like CET and Mehler reaction, specifically avoiding the over-reduction of the PETC (Figure 3). G\u00f3mez et al.

As reported by Shikanai and Yamamoto (2017), under steady-state conditions, Flvs have poor access to either NADPH or Fd, due to activation of the Calvin-Benson cycle, but may regain functionality under highly reduced stromal conditions. Here, the growth of A. thaliana plants heterologously expressing Flv responded differentially to the intensity of light provided (Figure 1). Under low light intensity conditions, electron transport is typically limited by the availability of photons, so that there is no need of relief with respect to the electron pressure on the PETC. The latter becomes important as the light intensity increases, and the Flv system is able to dissipate surplus reducing equivalents as long as the light intensity does not become excessive (Figure 1). Indeed, plants look stressed at this irradiation levels, as revealed by the color of the leaves (presumably due to anthocyanin accumulation, a typical response to high light). Wild type plants exhibited light stress symptoms during early exposure but acclimatized later, a similar phenomenon observed in Flv-expressing plants.

Here, we cannot exclude the possibility that heterologous expression of the Flvs provided an AEF able to function independently of the cyclic electron transport pathway and to contribute to the ATP demand, consequently enhancing growth. The adenylate pool is also an important regulator of plant metabolism (Geigenberger et al., 2010). In the Flv transgenics, an increased ATP level served to boost the level of activity in the Calvin-Benson cycle, which in turn helped to maintain a high level of hexose phosphate during the middle of the light period (Figure 7a,b). The hexose phosphates and ADPGlc (Figure 7a-d) accumulated by the Flv transgenics are most likely used to synthesize sucrose and starch during the day, serving to stimulate plant growth (Figure 5a,b).

Coral colonies at different depths may host distinctive symbiotic algae with contrasting photoacclimation capabilities that grant their hosts the ability to thrive in certain light environments (Rowan et al. 1997; Warner et al. 2006). Because of these differences in photoacclimation and the prevalence of specific associations with coral hosts, zonation by light has been regarded as a primary form of niche partitioning in symbiotic corals (Iglesias-Prieto et al. 2004).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "fa39aded-bc84-4fc5-aa6d-ae9b3e534eaf": {"text": "While the influence of different species of symbiotic algae on the ecophysiology of reef-building corals has been studied, the effect of other coral-associated microorganisms is less known, specially across depth-segregated species (Rohwer et al. 2002; Pantos et al. 2015). However, the interest on coral-associated microbes and their roles in maintaining health and preventing diseases has increased substantially (Kellogg et al. 2013; Peixoto et al. 2017). From an eco-evolutionary perspective, the evidence suggests that coral-associated bacterial assemblages can be highly variable although \u201cfootprints\u201d of unique microbial assemblages appear to be mediated by a combination of host species and local environmental conditions (Rohwer et al. 2002; Marchioro et al. 2020).

The Orbicella species complex, dominant in Caribbean reefs, was initially regarded as one species with ecotypic variation, but recent research revealed three species partially segregated by depth (Weil and Knowlton 1994; Fukami et al. 2004; Levitan et al. 2011). O. annularis is a high-light specialist which forms columns with senescent edges, while O. franksi is a low-light specialist forming irregular mounds and plates. O. faveolata form massive mounds and can overlap with both O. annularis and O. franksi habitats. The three Orbicella species are closely related with incomplete lineage sorting across nuclear and mitochondrial markers (Weil and Knowlton 1994; Fukami et al. 2004). The symbiotic dinoflagellate communities (Rowan et al. 1997; Kemp et al. 2015) as well as the photobiology of this species complex have been extensively studied (Warner et al. 2006; Scheufen et al. 2017), enabling the identification of important differences mediated by environmental gradients.

By contrast, O. franksi maintained a robust physiological performance, a resilient microbiome composition with no significant community shifts or increased variability, and low mortality at both depths. Our study suggests that O. annularis is adapted to shallow environments characterized by a higher and more variable temperature and light regimes, while O. franksi is physiologically able to live in both shallow and deep habitats. The niches of these sibling species have diverged, and a large component of the niche separation seems to be related to variations in the photoacclimation capabilities and the microbial community of each species.

The vertical habitat compression in both species is consistent with the Kd measured in Bocas del Toro (0.40 m-1), which is notably higher than in clear-water sites (0.06 m-1 in Cura\u00e7ao and 0.08 m-1 in Belize (Banaszak et al. 1998; Vermeij and Bak 2002)) and reflects the effect of the heavy rainfall patterns and runoff in the region on the optical properties of the water column (Kaufmann and Thompson 2005).

However, the extremely low values of Qm reflect a trivial photosynthetic contribution of O. annularis symbionts to the host metabolism due to light-limited photosynthesis (Iglesias-Prieto et al. 2004), suggesting that the photoacclimation potential is insufficient to compensate for the low-light conditions of deep environments. Photoacclimation of O. franksi fragments transplanted to the shallow environment resulted in an increased fraction of photo-inactivated PSII reaction centers and capacity for thermal dissipation of excessive light energy absorbed (Hoegh-Guldberg and Jones 1999; Gorbunov et al. 2001). But in contrast to O. annularis, the estimated Qm in O. franksi do not indicate the occurrence of chronic photoinhibition in the shallow environment nor light-limitation in the deep environment, suggesting that O. franksi can maintain a more robust physiological performance across depths.

Its morphology (typically columnar) helps regulate the distribution of light energy for symbiotic algae across the colony surface, representing an advantageous strategy in high-light environments because it reduces the coral tissue area subjected to excessive irradiance (Kaniewska et al. 2011). When transplanted deep, this morphology may lead to acute light energy limitation which, in combination with the insufficient acclimation potential to compensate for low-light, can lead to negative energetic balances for the whole colony and eventual death. O. franksi, on the other hand, produce plate-like colonies to maximize light capture in deep environments. When transplanted to shallow well-lit environments, despite a potential for successful photoacclimation as indicated by our results, the plate-like morphology limits the capacity to regulate the internal light climate and allows very slow vertical growth.

Surprisingly, this thermotolerant symbiont (ITS type D1/D1bl) was found in nearly 20% of O. franksi colonies from the deep environment. The increased abundance of D. trenchii in O. franksi may be related with the runoff impacts in the water column (e.g., sedimentation and nutrient enrichment), a reduction in light penetration, and the mechanisms by which the coral-algae symbiosis interact with these environmental conditions (Garren et al. 2006). The prevalence of Breviolum genotypes in O. annularis and Cladocopium genotypes in O. franksi, both in the shallow and deep transplant sites, is consistent with previous reports (LaJeunesse 2002; Garren et al. 2006) and may indicate the formation of stable associations explained by the photoacclimative capabilities of dinoflagellates and the variability of physical factors within the vertical distribution range of each coral species (LaJeunesse 2002; Iglesias-Prieto et al. 2004).

In late summer, when sea ice cover is at a minimum and the mixed layer is shallow and highly stratified, phytoplankton are exposed to high solar irradiances and low nutrient concentrations [2]. Under these conditions, the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of Arctic phytoplankton becomes nitrogen-limited [3]\u2013[5]. However, localized regions of elevated productivity can persist where various processes transport nutrients into the mixed layer, including upwelling, tidal mixing, and freshwater input from rivers and glaciers [6]\u2013[8]. Modelling studies suggest that Barrow Strait in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is one such productivity hotspot, with strong tidal currents and shallow sills driving vertical mixing in a region where Pacific and Atlantic-derived water masses converge [9], [10]. Additionally, Barrow Strait receives glacial and land-derived nutrients from the Cornwallis and Devon Island rivers [11], [12]. Rapid climate change in the Arctic is expected to have complex effects on these nutrient delivery mechanisms through the intensification of coastal erosion [13], increasing river inputs [14] and reduced vertical mixing due to intensifying stratification [15], [16]. At present, it is unclear how phytoplankton productivity will respond to these anticipated perturbations. Assessing phytoplankton productivity in physically-dynamic marine waters requires high spatial resolution measurements that cannot be obtained from traditional discrete bottle incubation methods, such as 14C uptake experiments. For this reason, oceanographic field studies have increasingly employed continuous sampling of surface water properties using variable chlorophyll a (Chla) fluorescence from Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometry (FRRf) and other related methods to rapidly and autonomously assess phytoplankton photophysiology and productivity (e.g. [17]\u2013[21]). Such variable fluorescence techniques rely on the inverse relationship between Chla fluorescence and photochemistry. These processes, along with heat dissipation, represent the three energy dissipation pathways of absorbed light energy within Photosystem II (PSII) [22]. Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometry operates by supplying rapid excitation light pulses to progressively saturate the photosynthetic pathway and simultaneously induce a measurable Chla fluorescence response \u2013 often referred to as a fluorescence transient [23]. Analysis of Chla fluorescence transients provides information on the photochemical efficiency and functional absorption cross section of PSII, as well as estimates of the turnover rate of photosynthetic electron transport chain molecules [24], [25]. Fast Repetition Rate fluorescence transients can be obtained nearly instantaneously, offering opportunities for very high temporal and spatial resolution measurements.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "fdba73c9-764e-4a73-9a78-f004fe164880": {"text": "Primary productivity is typically estimated from variable Chla fluorescence measurements by calculating the rate of photosynthetic electron transport out of PSII (ETRPSII).

Each algorithm relies on the same principles of light harvesting and photosynthetic electron transport, but arrive at ETRPSII estimates using slightly different, but theoretically equivalent, combinations of photophysiological metrics. As a result, different algorithms confer different field-sampling advantages and challenges (see [31]). The so-called \u2018amplitude\u2019 based approach (abbreviated ETRa; sometimes also referred to as the sigma-algorithm), calculates ETRPSII as the product of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), the functional absorption cross section of PSII in the dark-acclimated state (\u03c3PSII), and the photochemical efficiency of PSII normalized by the dark-acclimated maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII [27]. This approach reduces uncertainty in ETRPSII estimates by using \u03c3PSII measurements made in the dark-acclimated state, which are subject to less noise than \u03c3PSII\u2032 measurements made in the light [31].

Optimal dark acclimation times vary between phytoplankton species, and depend to a large extent on the environmental history of samples [33], making it challenging to design widely applicable field protocols for high resolution data acquisition. In practice, applied dark-acclimation periods range from 5-30 minutes (e.g. [34], [35]). Many FRRf field deployments have focused on discrete sample analysis, applying extended dark acclimation periods to ensure samples reach a short-term steady state condition [25], [36]\u2013[38]. Such discrete sample analysis enables standardized measurements and characterization of light-dependent physiological responses, at the cost of significantly reduced spatial and temporal measurement resolution.

First, increased nitrogen availability enables protein synthesis needed to repair inactive reaction centers [55], [56]. Second, localized nutrient loading may indirectly affect photophysiology by stimulating a shift from small to larger phytoplankton species, for instance from nano-flagellates to diatoms [50]. Unfortunately, we lack information on phytoplankton assemblage composition, and thus cannot directly examine any potential taxonomic effects on photophysiology. However, such a shift from small to large cells would be expected to drive a decrease in \u03c3PSII, concurrent with increases in F/F [49], which we did not observe. Previous pigment analyses conducted in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago found that Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait were both dominated by diatom species, followed by dinoflagellates, in summer [57].

Notably, the extent of these quenching effects was a predictable function of the short-term light history experienced by in situ phytoplankton assemblages (Fig 3d). Previous studies examining the drivers of NPQ variability [58]\u2013[60] suggest that the magnitude of NPQ effects at a given light level is tied to a number of environmental factors (e.g. temperature and CO2 concentrations), phytoplankton taxonomy and physiological status. Given these sources of variability, NPQ relaxation times needed for robust F/F measurements are expected to differ significantly across ocean regimes. In cold waters, such as those encountered along our ship track, NPQ relaxation is slower [61], and this may have contributed to the longer-lived quenching observed in our low-light samples. As the spatial and temporal resolution of F/F and ETRa measurements are constrained by such acclimation periods, it is recommended that future field deployments of FRRf conduct experiments using natural assemblages to determine the regional minimum relaxation period necessary to achieve steady-state dark-acclimation. This acclimation step can then be incorporated into underway FRRf protocols, resulting in more robust ETRa estimates, albeit with reduced measurement frequency. Such routine determinations of the minimum NPQ relaxation time requirements have not been commonly carried out for marine phytoplankton [25]. As a result, there is little systematic knowledge of the global variability of NPQ relaxation times. Adopting such pre-study tests (or within protocol) as standard practice would improve current understanding of environmental and taxonomic controls on NPQ relaxation kinetics. Moreover, it may be necessary to adjust the length of the dark-acclimation period to reflect changing conditions over the duration of a cruise.

The difference in wavelength responsiveness may be attributed to differing natural habitats. Chlamydomonas primarily inhabit the hydrosphere and wetland areas (e.g. mud, soil, wetland, and swamp), wherein the majority of UV radiation is in the UV-A region because UV-B is easily absorbed by dissolved or suspended organic/inorganic compounds in the water (Williamson and Rose, 2010). UV-A photons are much more abundant in land area, thus land plants were reported to sense UV-A via UVR8 (Rai et al., 2020). In addition to this, plants on land are exposed to more UV-B (Yin and Ulm, 2017), which causes more damage to nucleic acid and proteins compared with UV-A; therefore, land plants need to sense UV-B preferentially over long-wavelength UV. This habitat difference may explain why green photosynthetic organisms have developed a UV response to relatively long-wavelength UV (including UV-A) in the water and to relatively short-wavelength UV (mainly UV-B) in terrestrial environments.

An exposure to low nonfreezing temperatures induces morphological and physiological changes in plants that result in the development of acquired freezing tolerance [3]. Many plants increase in freezing tolerance in response to low but non-freezing temperatures through a sophisticated reconfiguration of molecules at various levels of biological organization, a process called cold acclimation [4-8]. When wheat plants grown at normal warm temperatures are subjected to a temperature of 5 \u00b0C, they are killed, but after cold acclimation, they can survive temperatures as low as -20 \u00b0C [9]. Non-acclimated rye, for example, is killed by freezing at about \u22125 \u00b0C, but after a period of exposure to low nonfreezing temperature, it can survive below \u221230\u00b0C [10]. In freezing sensitive plants, ice formation occurs inside the cytoplasm, which kills the cell. However, ice forms extracellularly withdrawing water from inside the cell in freezing tolerant plants [11]. As the temperature goes down, ice formation accelerates. Cells of freezing tolerant plants are killed when they cannot tolerate the cellular dehydration, because of failure of the membrane [12]. Such defects include alteration in membrane lipid composition or metabolic modifications [13], changes in protein content [14], enzyme activities [15], redistribution of intracellular calcium ions [16], cellular leakage of electrolytes and amino acids, and a diversion of electron flow to alternate pathways [17]. Cold acclimated plants have a higher concentration of starch at the end of the acclimation period than non-acclimated plants. During chilling, cold acclimated plants may demonstrate an osmotic adjustment, increasing solute concentration and lowering cell sap freezing point. Osmotic adjustment included, but was not completely explained by, the accumulation of free sugars [18]. Thomas and James [19] obtained a similar result in genotypes of Lolium perenne that were capable of cold acclimation. At the molecular levels, exposing plants to low temperature involves hundreds of cold-induced genes causing extensive reorganization of the transcriptomes [7].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "d161ad28-0e79-4e99-98bd-2ec0227bb1fb": {"text": "Photosynthetic gas exchange in a plant can be summarized in an equation A = R + Pgross, where A is net CO2 assimilation or net photosynthesis, R is respiration and Pgross is gross photosynthesis [20-23]. The change in photosynthetic characteristics in response to varying temperature plays an important role in plant adaptations to different environments [24]. Assimilation is inhibited when plants are exposed to short-term low temperatures [25], which is due to accumulation of soluble saccharides and reduced orthophosphate cycling from the cytosol back to the chloroplast, where the low temperature limits the ATP synthesis required for RuBP regeneration. In addition low temperature results in the expression of dehydrins, which help to protect the plant from dehydration [26]. Suppression in assimilation in cold-stressed plants results from the combined effects of light and cold temperature. Previous studies have shown that Photosynthesis is significantly reduced in Vitis vinifera [27] and in jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) after exposure to subfreezing temperature at night due to dark respiration [28]. The amount of dark respiration in cold acclimated plant varies from species to species. For example, the dark respiration of cold-acclimated Larix decidua was twice that of warm-acclimated plants at all temperatures [29].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "2e2a4472-f2e0-4dc6-87a4-b48d1e2100e6": {"text": "Stomatal conductance depends on multiple factors such as rate of carboxylation, internal CO2 concentration, shape and size of the stomatal pores, age of the leaf, humidity, temperature, light and drought [30-32], which plays an important role in the net plant photosynthesis [20,23,33]. As plants are subjected to drier conditions, their stomatal conductance declines to maintain high water use efficiency [34]. Assimilation and stomatal conductance typically decline and internal CO2 concentration increases with increasing drought stress [30,34-36]. Bohl et al. [37] demonstrated the dehydration of freezing tolerant cells, and the lethal effects of excess dehydration on Potentilla gracilis Dougl. ex Hook var. gracilis (Family Rosaceae). They also showed P. gracilis has the ability to tolerate frost formation during the growing season responding to chilling temperatures by increasing freezing tolerance. This plant grows in a stressful habitat at an altitude of 3000m of the Rocky Mountains of the United States. A number of physical factors vary daily and seasonally in its native site. Daily temperature can range between 25 \u00b0C during the day and \u20135 \u00b0C at night; light levels can vary from dim (cloudy) to bright, with high UV levels. Plants may experience water stress ranging from severe drying to flooding. The plant has to face two types of dehydration in a 24 h period: nocturnal dehydration due to freezing temperatures, and diurnal dehydration due to high evaporative demand from high light intensity and high temperatures in the afternoon. The short annual growth period lasts approximately 2.5 months, during which, the plant has to complete its growth and reproduction despite being under stressful conditions.

The overshooting of gs in response to a step change in PFD is presumably due to a drop in intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) as A increased at the higher PFD. The subsequent slight decrease in gs while PFD remained constant was likely due to higher Ci associated with the overshoot of gs. Above the PFD of 1300 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, A declined slightly, perhaps due to increased photoinhibition associated with high PFD, and to photorespiration, associated with high oxygen evolution in the light reaction. Assimilation decreased sharply at the end of the trial as PFD dropped suddenly; the corresponding value of gs decreased in parallel. This must be because of the higher rate of stomatal closure than the rate of stomatal opening due to steep increases in PFD.", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "24b88c11-8c60-45f7-a2b8-be30a1a99df0": {"text": "When measured at 15 \u00b0C, A increased with increasing PFD, showing that A was limited by the light reaction portion of photosynthesis. At any point on the curve A consists of the sum of respiration (all forms) and gross photosynthesis (A = R + Pgross). Dark respiration can be seen as the negative value of A at zero light. The light compensation point is the value of PFD at which the rate of respiration equals that of gross photosynthesis; thus A equals zero [31]. The quantum yield (assimilation per unit PFD, the slope of this curve) was highest between PFD levels of 0 and 25\u00b5mol m-2 s-1. Assimilation continued to increase with the increased PFD up to the first point at which A reached the maximum value. The LSP for this point was 1300 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. Above the LSP, A was predominantly limited by the dark reaction. The quantum yield gradually decreased as the LSP was approached, showing the gradual shift from light reaction limited A to dark reaction limited A. At higher PFDs the assimilation declined slightly. This pattern is likely to be caused by a combination of photoprotection, inadequate repair of light damage to photosystem II, and photorespiration. A comparison between A at 100 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 before and after exposure to high PFD showed that A was reduced by approximately 50%. This inhibition of photosynthesis indicates reduction in efficiency of the light reaction, likely due to conversion of xanthophylls between nonprotectant and protectant forms, and imbalance between the rates of the normal light-induced damage to photosystem II and the repair of this system [1]. The pattern of changes of gs with increasing PFD followed that of A in response to PFD (Figure 4). This is expected because gs and A are both directly affected by light, and because as A rises, Ci drops, and stomata respond to the lowered Ci by opening further. The result is that gs adjusts to allow optimal CO2 for photosynthesis [1]. The value of gs in Rosa hybrida ranged from 0.10 to 0.52 mol m-2 s-1 [46], similar to the values seen for P. gracilis in the present study.", "figure_ref": ["fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "867459ec-25dc-4c11-a65a-87419e8fecfb": {"text": "Effect of PFD and night temperature on photosynthetic assimilation (A; left) and stomatal conductance (gs; right) of P. gracilis at different measurement temperatures.

Dark respiration typically increased with the increase in measurement temperature. Respiratory enzymes become more active at higher temperatures [40]. Values of LCP decreased as measurement temperature increased. This shows that the increase in the rate of gross photosynthesis with increasing measurement temperature exceeded the corresponding increase in respiration. In the field, this can be highly significant because at higher temperatures, photosynthetic products can increase even in very low light, while at lower temperatures at the same light level, photosynthate is being consumed. For P. gracilis in the field, these conditions occur only momentarily on clear days, but may occur for considerable periods in morning or afternoon during cloudy or foggy days. In general, A progressively increased with increases in measurement temperature at a particular PFD. Differences between 5 and 15 \u00b0C were substantially larger than those between 15 and 25 \u00b0C. Maximum assimilation increased with increases in measurement temperature. Thus P. gracilis should grow considerably faster at higher temperatures in the field. Maximum assimilation for two woody Rosa species was 18.7 and 16.8 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 [47], close to the values observed for P. gracilis at 25 \u00b0C.

The combination of high PFD and cold temperature is expected to pose photosynthetic challenges to plants [48,49]. Photosynthetic enzyme activity is sensitive to low temperature, which affects chloroplasts directly [24]. At low temperatures the inhibition of A is due to an accumulation of soluble saccharides and reduced orthophosphate cycling from the cytosol back to the chloroplast. It limits ATP synthesis required for RuBP regeneration [24]; [26]. After chilling tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants for a short time [50], impairment of rubisco (the enzyme that binds CO2) also took place, reducing A. On the other hand, as temperatures drop, the energy produced by the light reaction (a mostly physical process) cannot be fully used by the dark reaction (a mostly enzymatic process), which can lead to the damage of the photosynthetic apparatus [23]. The combination of high light and low temperature may be harmful, involving damage to photosystem II by high PFD. The repair rate of photosystem II will be lower, as the enzymes involved are less active at lower temperatures [51,52]. Light exposure at low temperature also causes an inhibition of photosystem I in barley and cucumber [53]. High temperature and high PFD have also been shown to have additive effects on photoinhibition [54], but this did not occur in the present study. The inhibition of photosynthesis in P. gracilis following high light may be due to the reversible conversion of xanthophylls between non-protectant (non-absorbing) and protectant (light absorbing) forms, which reduce the light getting to the chlorophyll [49,55]. This may reduce damage to the chloroplasts, at the expense of photosynthesis. The pattern of change in gs with measurement temperature generally followed the pattern of change in A with measurement temperature. At temperatures from 10 to 20 \u00b0C, values overlap substantially, while those at 5 and 25 \u00b0C are considerably lower and higher, respectively, than the others.

The reduction in A after chilling nights in the present study is also in agreement with investigations of grape (Vitis vinifera) [27] and jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) [28]. Assimilation is also inhibited in winter rye when plants are exposed to short-term (prior night) low temperatures [25] [25]. It is possible that chilling nights immediately following exposure to high PFD results in a failure to fully repair photosystem II.

It is likely that the temperature optima for the limiting enzymes in the dark reaction are near 20 \u00b0C, a common temperature in the field on sunny days. In all other cases, measurement temperature had a pronounced effect, presumably because reaction rates decline at lower temperatures. Dark respiration rates following chilling nights were typically slightly lower than rates following warm nights, and also increased with measurement temperature (Figure 3).

However, Assimilation was essentially identical for the driest plants (\u201cvery dry\u201d). The wet plants in these trials ranged from -.35 to -.50 MPa (\u22123.5 to -5.0 bars), a common value for plants in moist field sites on humid or cloudy days. The range for dry plants was -.85 to -1.10 MPa; for very dry plants (with curled leaves) water potentials ranged from -1.70 to -1.95 MPa. These values can be found for P. gracilis under field conditions on warm, dry days, even with adequate soil moisture. At 20 \u00b0C, A was highest for wet plants, and was not saturated at the highest PFD measured (Figure 3). Although plants typically saturate near 1000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 [23], some can utilize higher levels of light. For example, the LSP of Sorghum bicolor was 1707 and 2973 [60] for two different genotypes under wet conditions. These P. gracilis plants were rewatered after being subjected to very dry conditions (defined above); the high values of A on the following day show that they are able to recover quickly from severe drought stress. The dry and very dry plants were different in that A was over twice as high for the dry plants. For both groups, A saturated near 900 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, and remained largely the same at higher PFDs. Reduction of photosynthesis may be caused by both stomatal and nonstomatal factors. Nonstomatal factors here include short-term damage to chloroplasts [36] and photosynthetic enzymes in the dark reaction that are sensitive to water potential [61]. Under drought conditions, A is controlled mostly by nonstomatal factors [30]. At 15 \u00b0C, values of A for wet and dry plants were essentially identical up to 900 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, indicating that water potential was not limiting assimilation at these lower PFDs (Figure 3). Above this range, water potential limited assimilation; the effect was more pronounced at higher light levels. Assimilation was substantially lowered throughout the entire range of PFD for the driest plants, indicating a much greater limitation imposed by this extreme water stress.

Low water potential and low temperature are characterized by lower values of gs in P. gracilus. For wet plants at 20 \u00b0C, the high value of gs is associated with a high assimilation rate, and Amax was the highest of all trials. The relationship between gs and A is based on the fact that Ci controls both gs and A, and in turn gs and A control Ci [1]. As drought progresses, A decreases along with a decline in gs [34]. Our results were consistent with the finding s in two species of cedar (Cedrus atlantica and C. libani) [36]. When P. gracilis plants were rehydrated, A and gs reverted to the levels of unstressed plants. This is consistent with the findings in wheat [30] and teak [35]. This suggests that a short-term water stress brings about reversible effects.

Reverse phase protein arrays using similar human specimens suggested that VEGFR-2 Y996 was increased at 1 hour and 5 hours post-UV exposure (19). While the functional consequences of VEGFR-2 Y996 are unknown, this residue serves as a docking site for SH2, SH3, or PTB domain-containing proteins to convey downstream signaling (20, 21). VEGFR-2 Y1175 phosphorylation stimulates the PLC\u03b3-ERK1/2 cascade, regulates Ca2+ signaling as well as cellular survival and proliferation (22). Human keratinocytes and epidermis express VEGF receptors and co-receptors, and autocrine VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling is activated in response to moderate UVB irradiation (23, 24). VEGF is produced through distinct mechanisms by UVB and ROS (25), as UVB has been shown to activate VEGF in the presence of antioxidants (26). UVB and inflammatory mediator PGE2 directly upregulate VEGF in human dermal fibroblasts and indirectly elevate VEGF in human epidermal keratinocytes (27).

Under light stress conditions, however, the photosynthetic electron transport chain becomes saturated leading to the formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g., singlet oxygen (1O2) [1, 2], that can damage the photosystems and other cellular machineries, eventually leading to cell death. Accordingly, photosynthetic organisms have developed a variety of mechanisms, altogether referred-to as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), that are aimed at reducing the amount of energy reaching the photochemical reactions centers thereby avoiding accumulation of ROS [3]. In a vast majority of cyanobacterial strains, the main light-harvesting antenna is a large soluble complex, the phycobilisome (PBS), and the soluble 35 kDa photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) is at the center of the NPQ mechanism (for review: [4\u20136]). OCP is capable both of dissipating the excess energy harvested by the PBS [7], and of quenching the produced harmful singlet-oxygen [8, 9]. For the energy quenching mechanism to be elicited, OCP must be photoactivated, which triggers the changes in protein structure and pigment position required for PBS binding and discharge of its excessive energy [10, 11]. Specifically, upon absorption of a blue-green photon, OCP converts from an inactive dark-adapted state (denoted as OCPO, due to its orange color) into an active light-adapted state (denoted OCPR, due to its red color). OCPO is characterized by two absorption maxima at 475 and 495 nm (vibronic structure), while OCPR displays a single broader absorption peak between 510 and 530 nm [11]. The photoactivation quantum yield of the protein is notoriously low, viz. 0.2 % [12], meaning that the OCP-supported photoprotective mechanism is at play only under high light conditions and that the concentration of OCPR is null, or very low, in darkness and under low light conditions [11, 13]. Phylogenic studies of OCP sequences allowed their classification into three distinct clades, viz. OCP1, OCP2 and OCPX [14]. Members of the OCP1 clade are characterized by a slow OCPR to OCPO thermal recovery (at 8\u00b0C) that is accelerated by the presence of the fluorescence recovery protein (FRP), whereas OCP2 and OCPX exhibit a faster thermal recovery (even at 8\u00b0C) that is not affected by the presence of FRP [15, 16].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "1c8d7fdb-3a13-4e3f-8e46-a7dea81b4b8f": {"text": "The best characterized OCPs are OCP1s from Arthrospira maxima and Synechocystis PCC 6803, hereafter referred to as Arthrospira and Synechocystis OCP, respectively. For both, the dark-adapted structure was solved [8, 17], which revealed a conserved two-domain modular architecture. The fully \u03b1-helical N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-165), unique to cyanobacteria, and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 187-320), structurally belonging to the nuclear transport factor-2 superfamily (NTF2), encase at their interface a ketocarotenoid pigment, e.g. 3\u2019-hydroxyechineone (3\u2019-hECN) [8, 17]. Notwithstanding the presence of a linker that covalently attaches the NTD and CTD, the dark-adapted state is stabilized by two main protein interfaces, viz. (i) the central interdomain interface, which features two highly-conserved H-bond (N104-W277) and salt-bridge (R155-E244); and (ii) the interface between the N-terminal helix (also coined, N-terminal extension or NTE) and the CTD \u03b2-sheet [8], which features six to seven H-bonds depending on species. Additionally, the ketocarotenoid pigment buries \u2248 95% of its highly hydrophobic surface into the binding tunnel spanning the two domains, and therefore also contributes to the stabilization of the OCPO, with a buried surface area (BSA) of 786 \u00c52 and a surface complementarity of ~83%. The sole polar interactions between the ketocarotenoid and the protein scaffold are the H-bonds established between the carbonyl oxygen of its \u03b21 ring and the side chain hydroxyl and amine of CTD residues Y201 and W288 (Synechocystis OCP residue numbering), respectively [8, 17]. Rupture of these H-bonds is the first event along a photo-activation cascade that involves several \u2018red\u2019 intermediate states spanning the ps to second time scale [12, 18\u201320] and culminates with dissociation of the two domains following the 12 \u00c5 translocation of the carotenoid into the NTD [21]. Dissociation of the two domains is essential for the energy-quenching function, as only OCPR is capable of binding to the PBS [10, 11]. This activity is measured as the quenching of PBS fluorescence, itself induced by exposure to blue-light.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "b1486b9e-d910-4d2d-b6ad-050e21b1b750": {"text": "Despite the considerable knowledge acquired on OCP in the last decades, the photoactivation mechanism is still under debate. Notably, the very first instants of the photoactivation mechanism remains elusive. Numerous computational and time-resolved spectroscopic studies have recently sought to shed light on the structure, formation and decay of the carotenoid excited states associated with OCP photoactivation ([19, 22\u201324]; Figure 1). Notably, it was demonstrated that upon photoexcitation, three ps-lived intermediate states are formed following the sub-ps decay of the initial S2 state, viz. an S1 and an intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) excited states [25, 26], and an S* state [19] that was initially proposed to correspond to a vibrationally hot S0 population [27]. Recently, however, it was proposed that the S* state, characterized by a longer lifetime than the S1 and ICT states [19, 28], is also an excited state which serves as the precursor of the first photoproduct, P1, in which the H-bonds between the carotenoid and the protein are broken and the protein is (therefore) already \u2018red\u2019 (difference absorption spectrum peaking at 565 nm) [19]. The debate however remains open concerning the nature of the S* state [29\u201331] and its putative role as the precursor of P1. Indeed, recent results from our laboratories show that while the photoactivation speed of OCPR is independent of irradiation light (470 nm versus 540 nm), the concentration of S* decreases by \u2248 30% when 540 nm light is used to trigger photoactivation (Nizinski et al., submitted; doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.26.474187). Hence, S* cannot be the sole precursor of P1. Evolution of this state (50 ns lifetime), wherein the carotenoid is likely untethered from its CTD H-bonding partners, leads to a repositioning of the carotenoid in the tunnel, in close vicinity of the dark-state position (P2; 0.5 \u2013 1 \u00b5s) [19]. After a first partial movement into the NTD (P2\u2019; 10 \u00b5s) [19], the ketocarotenoid completes its translocation into the NTD, reaching the position it occupies in the final OCPR in around 10 \u00b5s (P3);[19, 23]. Conformational changes in the NTE and CTT ensue (PM and PX ~10 ms and 35 ms), followed by an opening of the protein upon dissociation of the two domains (~100 ms) [23]. Thus, the formation of the photoactive OCPR is a multi-step reaction spanning at least fourteen decades in times [12, 19, 23]. All steps, excluding the P2\u2019 to P3 and P3 to PM transitions, are accompanied by recovery to the initial OCPO state, explaining the low quantum yield. About 1 and 0.2 % of molecules reach the P1 state [19] and the final OCPR state [12, 19, 23] (Nizinski et al., submitted; doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.26.474187) (Figure 1), respectively.", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "823a8445-0dc2-4ab7-85f3-442f1d8919ec": {"text": "The figure which presents a working model for OCP photoactivation, summarizes findings from multiple studies [12, 19, 23].

PN/PM and PX were observed by Maksimov et al. in time-resolved fluorimetry experiments upon excitation at 262 nm of the ECN-functionalized OCP-3FH mutant (W41F, W101F, W110F and W277H) featuring a single tryptophan at position W288 [23].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "09797436-ef82-43ea-903d-58e4360daa31": {"text": "In all recent studies on OCP, the protein was expressed recombinantly [32] and to accelerate purification, a six-histidine tag (6XHis-tag) was introduced at the N-terminus (OCP produced in E. coli cells) or C-terminus (OCP produced in Synechocystis and E. coli cells). However, it was shown that after migration of the carotenoid from the NTD/CTD interface into the NTD (\u2248 0.5 \u00b5s) formation of OCPR requires, prior to domain separation, the detachment of the N-terminal helix \u03b1A (or NTE) from the CTD \u03b2-sheet [19, 33, 34]. Likewise, the C-terminal helix \u03b1N (or CTT) was proposed to reposition upon domain separation \u2013 possibly to \u201cclog\u201d the otherwise-exposed highly-hydrophobic CTD-half of the carotenoid tunnel [34\u201336]. Hence, presence of a His-tag at either the N- or C-terminal extremity of the protein can influence the kinetics of photoactivation and thermal recovery, respectively. In support of this hypothesis, we recently reported the finding that His-tag position affects: i) the photoactivation efficiency, with OCPR accumulation being slower when the His-tag is present at the C-terminus (C-tagged OCP); ii) the lifetime of excited states, with those being shorter for C-tagged OCP); and iii) the spectral signatures of S1 and S* states. However, the position of the tag does not influence P1 formation quantum yield (QY) suggesting that the more efficient photoactivation of the N-tagged protein is related to molecular events occurring on the nano-to millisecond timescales (Nizinski et al., under revision). Regardless, it also remains unclear whether or not presence of the His-tag has an influence on PBS energy quenching and on thermal recovery. Also lacking is a thorough structure-function-dynamics comparison between OCP from various strains to understand how subtle changes in the structure may affect the function, its regulation or both. For example, it was recently reported that despite a lower intracellular OCP concentration and a quasi-strict conservation of the amino acids lining the OCP carotenoid tunnel, the amplitude of the OCP-related PBS-fluorescence quenching is larger in the cyanobacterium Planktothrix PCC 7805 than in Synechocystis PCC 6803 [37], and likewise for the PBS-fluorescence recovery.

Indeed, upon knock-out of the gene coding for the hydrolase converting ECN into hECN, Synechocystis OCP binds ECN [38], and likewise when the protein is overexpressed in Synechocystis cells, due to the low amount of hECN (\u2248 1% of all ketocarotenoids) [11, 39]. When expressed recombinantly in E. coli cells [32], Synechocystis OCP can be complexed with ECN, canthaxanthin (CAN) or zeaxanthin (ZEA), depending on the set of carotenoid-producing genes that are co-transformed with the gene coding for the OCP. This feature holds true for all OCP variants produced recombinantly in carotenoid-producing E. coli cells, including OCP1 from Synechocystis, Arthrospira and Tolypothrix [15, 32], OCP2 from Tolypothrix and Synechocystis 7508 [15, 16], and OCPX from Scytonema and Synechocystis 7508 [16]. To date, only Tolypothrix OCP was found to bind canthaxanthin (CAN) when overexpressed in Tolypothrix cells [30]. Early studies showed that the relative populations of the carotenoid S1 and ICT excited-states depend on the carotenoid that functionalizes OCP, with virtually no ICT in Synechocystis OCP functionalized with the fully symmetric CAN, but up to 50% ICT in OCP functionalized with the non-symmetric ECN [30, 40]. It was then proposed that the absence of the ICT state is a consequence of the fully symmetric nature of the CAN pigment, which is absent in ECN [30, 40]. However, the P1 state was not identified at the time, so that it remains elusive whether or not the change in functionalizing carotenoid also affects the yield of this presumed photoproductive intermediate.

A short-pulse titanium sapphire oscillator (Mai Tai, Spectra Physics, 70 fs pulse length) followed by a high-energy titanium sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Ace, Spectra Physics, 100 fs, 1 kHz) provided the 800 nm beam, which was further split to generate: (1) a 532 nm pump pulse in the optical parametric amplifier (Topas Prime with a NirUVVis frequency mixer) and (2) a white light continuum probe pulse in a sapphire crystal (430\u2013780 nm). The remaining 800 nm probe pulse photons were filtered just after white light continuum generation. The instrument response function (IRF) was estimated to be around 110 fs (FWHM). The pump diameter (FWHM) at the sample was approximately 250 \u00b5m, for a pulse energy of 0.8 \u00b5J. Absorbance was close to 0.7 at the excitation wavelength over a 2 mm optical path (55 \u00b5M or 1.9 mg/mL). The sample solution was stirred to keep the OCP solution fresh in the probed volume. The pump beam was depolarized to avoid anisotropy effects. To ensure that datasets are comparable to each other, they were all measured under identical conditions (at 22\u00b0C) during a single experimental session.

The slow recovery kinetics at low temperature of Syn-OCPRCAN is known, and shared by other OCP1s from Arthrospira and Tolypothrix [15, 16, 42], whereas the fast recovery kinetics of Plankto-OCPRCAN is unprecedented for members of the OCP1 clade. It is reminiscent of those displayed by members of the OCP2 [14, 16] and OCPX [16] clades. In these clades, the faster OCPR-to-OCPO recovery rate coincides with the inability to interact with FRP [15, 16].

Irrespective of the species, OCPR accumulation is slower in ECN-functionalized than CAN-functionalized OCP (Figures 4A and 4B), while recovery is faster (Figure 4C and 4D). For example, the initial slopes of OCPR accumulation by Ntag-Syn-OCPCAN and Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN are twice as high as those measured on their ECN-functionalized counterparts (Figures 4A and 4B).

The difference spectrum obtained \u2248 30 ps post-excitation (offset value in the sum of exponentials) is attributed to the P1 intermediate state. Using the GSB kinetics, and assuming that the S1, ICT and S* states form from S2 and parallelly decay to the ground state, we could further estimate the quantum yields of each, as well as of P1. In agreement with previous reports, the picosecond excited state dynamics and yields are similar for the four tested OCPs, with similar DAS observed for the ICT (blue), S1 (red), S* (green) and P1 (magenta) states, respectively (Figure 5C and 5D). However, a detailed analysis of DAS for CAN and ECN-OCPs (either Plankto or Syn) shows that the value of absorbance amplitude for S1 and ICT above 700 nm is higher for ECN, assigned to a more pronounced ICT character in the ICT and S1 states.

Indeed, on these timescales, the maximum difference-absorbance varies between 563 nm, characteristic of the P1 state, and 550 nm, signing for OCPR.

Recall that these states were proposed to be associated with (i) rupture of H-bonds between the carotenoid and the protein scaffold (P1); (ii) translocation of the carotenoid from the NTD/CTD interface into the NTD (P2-P2\u2019, P3); and (iii) NTE and CTT detachment (PM) followed by dissociation of the two domains (PX), respectively.

First, irrespective of the carotenoid, the starting difference absorbance signal (at 50 ns) is higher for Plankto-OCP (~0.002) than for Syn-OCP (~0.0015), suggesting a higher P1 yield (Figure 6). This result contradicts the above assumption that the P1 yield is the same for all investigated OCPs, but can be rationalized by recalling that (i) in the fs-ns experiments, the GSB band at 490 nm is used to estimate the P1 yield, instead of the characteristic positive absorption band at 563 nm, in the ns-s experiments; and most importantly (ii) a large fraction of P1 reverts to the dark-adapted OCPO state. Thus, the higher P1 yield observed for Plankto-OCP at the start of ns-s transient absorption experiments (50 ns) could be related to a reduced recovery from P1 of the Plankto-OCPO state. Irrespective of the functionalizing carotenoid, the difference absorptions of Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP drop by about 60 % and 40 % on the ns - \u00b5s time scale, respectively. The larger drop in Plankto-OCP signal could underlie sub-optimal translocation of the carotenoid into the Plankto-NTD, compared to the Syn-NTD. On the \u00b5s-s time scale, the most important differences between Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP are visible in the \u00b5s to ms timescale, whereas differences between CAN- and ECN-functionalized OCP concentrate in the ms-s time window. Thus, both carotenoid translocation and NTE/CTT detachments seem to be affected by the change in protein scaffold, however, it is domain dissociation that is most affected by a change in the functionalizing carotenoid. This step appears to be faster and more efficient in CAN-functionalized OCP, with a slight increase in \u0394A (550 nm) being visible after 1 ms, whereas recovery to the initial state is higher for ECN-functionalized OCP, as evidenced by the decrease of \u0394A (550nm). Of note, this decline is present only in ECN-functionalized OCPs, in accordance with the observation that CAN-functionalized OCP can be photoactivated more efficiently. In the case of Plankto-OCPCAN, we observe faster domain separation and no recovery to OCPO on the \u00b5s-s timescale (100% efficiency from P3 to final OCPR).

Likewise, for the P3/PN/PX states (i.e., on the 0.1-10 ms time scale), either one or two exponentials were required to fit the data, yielding lifetimes in the order of 0.1-1 ms.

The experimental setup did not allow to evaluate a lifetime for OCPR, but previous reports have pointed to the second timescale [23]. Nevertheless, our data establish that the OCPR yield is higher for CAN-functionalized OCP, and that Plankto-OCP photoactivates more efficiently. Thus, the differences observed in the photoactivation efficiency of CAN- and ECN-functionalized Plankto- and Syn-OCP stem from evolutions observed during the (comparatively-slow) carotenoid translocation, NTE/CTT detachment and domain dissociation steps \u2013 but not from changes in the excited-state dynamics of the OCP-embedded carotenoid.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tbl1"]}, "3fe374e5-e570-450a-a729-c9574fec2d51": {"text": "We then inquired the energy-quenching performance of the various ECN- and CAN-functionalized OCPs, focusing on OCP and PBS from Synechocystis and Planktothrix.

We note that in the C2 structures, the relative contributions of \u03b1A and \u03b1B to the BSA at the dimerization interface hardly vary depending on the functionalizing carotenoid, amounting to respectively 32 and 40 % in Plankto-OCPCAN, and 30 and 42 %, in Plankto-OCPECN (Supplementary Table S1). Nonetheless, alike in the P21 structures, the two H-bonds affixing \u03b1A and \u03b1B from facing monomers in the C2 Plankto-OCPCAN dimer, i.e., R9(NH2)-Q30(O) and R9(NH1)-L31(O), are absent in the C2 Plankto-OCPECN dimer. Thus, these H-bonds are present in both the P21 and C2 Plankto-OCPCAN structures, but in neither of the Plankto-OCPECN structures. The rest of the H-bonding network at the dimerization interface is again overall preserved in the two C2 structures, with two to three H-bonds between \u03b1A and the facing \u03b1H (T15(O)-N134(ND2) and T17(OG1)-N134(ND2) in the two structures, and N14(OD1) to A133(N) in the Plankto-OCPCAN structure only), one H-bond between \u03b1A and the facing \u03b1E-\u03b1F loop (D6(OD2)-T90(OG1) in the two structures and a salt-bridge between facing \u03b1B residues (D19(OD2)-R27(NE)) (Figure 9D). The latter salt-bridge is preserved among all OCP structures reported thus far, suggesting that it is a defining interaction in the naturally-occurring OCP dimer. Indeed, it was shown that mutation into a leucine of R27 yields a constitutively monomeric OCP [16]. The extent of the biological dimerization interface is also overall preserved among all available OCP structures including ours, with a mean BSA of 1051 \u00b1 90 \u00c52 (viz. 6pq1, 5ui2, 5hgr, 3mg1, 4xb5, and 7qd0, 7qcZ, 7qd1 and 7qd2).

Interface X involves multiple secondary structure elements, including the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop (~ 20 and 36 % of the overall BSA in C2 and P21 crystals, respectively), \u03b1D (~ 20 and 10 %, respectively), \u03b1E (~ 10 and 5 %, respectively), \u03b1G and the \u03b1G-\u03b1H loop (20 and 30 %, respectively), the linker (20 and 10 %), and the \u03b1M-\u03b24 (~ 5 and 4 %, respectively) and \u03b25-\u03b26 (~ 2 and 5 %, respectively) loops (Supplementary Table S3). Only the first two structural elements contribute H-bonds at interface X in the P21 crystals, whereas all of them do in the C2 crystals (Supplementary Table S3). Conformational changes in \u03b1G and in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops, and resultantly changes in the BSA contributed by the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop (+8 and +24 % in the Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN and Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structures, respectively), \u03b1D (\u221264 and \u221268 %, respectively), \u03b1E (\u221270 and \u221266 %, respectively) and the linker (\u221274 and \u221268 %, respectively), explain the shrunken interface X in the P21 crystals, compared to the C2 crystals (Supplementary Table S3).

As a result, the predicted radii of gyration (Rg) for the P21 asymmetric unit dimers (26.16 and 26.12 \u00c5 for Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN and Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN, respectively) are larger than those predicted for the C2 crystallographic dimers (26.01 and 25.90 \u00c5 for Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN and Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN, respectively) (Supplementary Table S2). Consistently, P21 chain B features a structure that is intermediate between P21 chain A and the unique C2 chain (change in opening-angle and distance between the NTD and CTD in P21 chain A with respect to P21 chain B: +3.3\u00b0 and +0.9 \u00c5 for Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN; +4.0\u00b0 and +0.7 \u00c5 for Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN) (Figure 11A).

Altogether, these changes affect the positioning of the carotenoid which, despite preservation of H-bonds from its carbonyl oxygen to Y203(OH) (2.5-2.8 \u00c5 distance between non-hydrogen atoms) and W290(NH1) (2.8-3.0 \u00c5 distance between non-hydrogen atoms) and a quasi-perfect alignment of its \u03b21-ring in the CTD, tilts towards Y44 in the P21 structures (Figure 11B). With respect to the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN structure, the tilt angles of the carotenoid are 3.8 and 1.8\u00b0 in chains A and B of the P21 Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structure, 3.2 and 2.9\u00b0 in chains A and B of the P21 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN structure, and 0.8\u00b0 in the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structure. Thus, crystal packing traps different conformations of the Ntag-Plankto-OCP monomers, which differ (i) in the conformation displayed, at interface X, by \u03b1G and the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops, (ii) in the opening angle between domains, at the NTD/CTD interface, (iii) in the opening angle between monomers, in the biological dimer; and (iv) in the positioning of the carotenoid (Figures 9\u201312). It is of important note that despite these changes, and the presence of two alternate side-chain conformations for R155 in the Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structures, the R155-E246 salt-bridge and N104-W279 H-bond, which support the NTD / CTD interface, are preserved in all structures (distance between non-hydrogen atoms 2.8-3.2 \u00c5) (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5). We also note that previously determined structures of Synechocystis, Anabaena, Tolypothrix and Arthrospira OCP align best with the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN and Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN, suggesting that these should be used for comparisons, rather than the P21 structures (Supplementary Table S2). In this context, it must be acknowledged that differences in the opening angle between the NTD and the CTD can also be seen from the comparison of the two chains constituting the asymmetric unit dimer in the Anabaena OCP structure (PDB id: 5hgr), with chain A aligning best with the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCP conformers. We last note that ECN-functionalized OCP monomers and dimers are more compact than the CAN-functionalized counterparts (Figure 11 and Supplementary Table S2), and that a similar trend is visible in the comparison of CAN-functionalized (PDB id: 4xb5; one chain with a predicted radius of gyration of 20.49 \u00c5) and ECN-functionalized (PDB id: 3mg1; two chains with predicted radii of gyration of 20.34 and 20.33 \u00c5) NtagSyn-OCP structures.

Calculated using the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN structure as a reference, these confirm that the main difference between the P21 chain A, P21 chain B and C2 structures is a change in the orientation of the NTD vs. the CTD, accompanied (or triggered) by a change in the conformation of \u03b1A and the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops. As a result, the two loops draw away from the CTD, pulling with them \u03b1C, \u03b1D, \u03b1E, \u03b1F and \u03b1G (Figure 13A). Conformational changes are far less pronounced in the CTD, where only \u03b25 slightly changes position, moving away from \u03b1J, \u03b22 and \u03b1M (Figure 13A). In this context, it should be recalled that aside \u03b1A, the NTD consists of two 4-helix bundles contributed by helices \u03b1B-\u03b1C-\u03b1H-\u03b1I and \u03b1D-\u03b1E-\u03b1F-\u03b1G, respectively, which appose one onto the other leaving a central void that constitutes the carotenoid tunnel in the NTD. Our structural comparison indicates that regions most affected by the change in space group are those linking the two bundles, with conformational changes affecting the position \u2013 but not the internal structure \u2013 of the second bundle with respect to the CTD. Interestingly, the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops are also the secondary structure elements most affected by the change in functionalizing carotenoid. It is visible from the comparison of the C2 structures, that these changes result in a modification of the distance between helices \u03b1D and \u03b1F, on the one hand, and the CTD, on the other hand. Thus, the structural dynamics at the basis of the change in space group and those resulting from the change in functionalizing carotenoid are localized in the same regions of the protein. This suggests that they could reflect a functional role. In line with this hypothesis, calculation of a DDM between the isolated NTD of Syn-OCPCAN, considered as a surrogate for the structure of the NTD in OCPR, and the NTD in the dark-adapted Syn-OCPCANO reveals major changes in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops (Figure 13B), which result in a dramatic rearrangement of the first \u03b1B-\u03b1C-\u03b1H-\u03b1I bundle whilst leaving the internal conformation of the \u03b1D-\u03b1E-\u03b1F-\u03b1G bundle unperturbed. Thus, like changes in space group and functionalizing carotenoid in Ntag-Plankto-OCP, photoactivation affects the internal structure and relative positioning of the Syn-OCP \u03b1B-\u03b1C-\u03b1H-\u03b1I bundle through conformational changes in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops, while the second \u03b1D-\u03b1E-\u03b1F-\u03b1G bundle appears stable and acts as a base. This observation is surprising given that the interface between the first bundle and the CTD is larger (BSA of 643.2 \u00c52; four H-bonds and a salt bridge) than that between the second bundle and the CTD (BSA of 189.3 \u00c52; 1 H-bond). Regardless, our results show that the two most mobile regions across the NTD \u2013 and therefore, across the whole Plankto-OCP \u2013 are the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops, making these the first candidates to explain the increased photoactivation efficiency of Plankto-OCP.", "figure_ref": ["fig13", "fig13", "fig13"], "table_ref": []}, "ef47026c-06ed-456b-9813-c507a7041e9d": {"text": "(A) Changes in C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distances across in the various ECN- and CAN-functionalized C2 and P21 chains were monitored by computing C\u03b1-C\u03b1 difference-distance matrices (DDM). As a reference structure, we used the C2 Plankto-OCP-CAN (2 first rows), or either chain A or C of the P21 PlanktoOCP-CAN structure (third line). In each DDM, the lower and upper panels (separated by a sketch of the secondary structure) show the changes in C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distances for alternate conformers A and B with respect to the reference structure. Indeed, alternate conformations are seen in all Plankto-OCP structures. The overall similarity between upper and lower panels indicates that alternate conformations hardly affect the protein backbone. In the P21 crystals, two chains are found, which either display a more expanded (chain A) or a more compact (chain B) structure, due to changes in the opening angle between the NTD and the CTD. The DDM further indicates that these changes stem from helix \u03b1D, and the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops, either drawing away (chain A) or coming closer (chain B) to the CTD, respectively. Comparison of the C2-CAN and C2-ECN structures suggests that the presence of CAN results in a more compact protein. Support to this hypothesis could not be obtained from comparison of the P21 chain A or P21 chain B structures. Nonetheless, we observe a similar trend when comparing, either in the CAN-functionalized or the ECN-functionalized states, P21 chain C and P21 chain A.

The \u03b1G-\u03b1H loop conformation is overall preserved among P21 structures, with only a slight displacement of \u03b1H observed between the P21 chains A and B, as a result of changes in the \u03b1C conformation concomitant to those in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop (Figures 11 and 13). The \u03b1G-\u03b1H loop conformation is yet more divergent among the C2 structures, with the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structure displaying two alternate main-chain conformations for the highly-conserved residues 122-VAPIPSGYKL-130, of which none overlaps with the conformations observed in C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN and in the P21 chains (Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, these changes in the conformations of the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops result in the opening/closing of water-channels from the protein surface to the carotenoid tunnel in the NTD. Briefly, four main channels (#1, #2, #3 and #4) can be identified on the basis of our structures (Supplementary Figures 7, 8 and 9). The first one (#1), which is colinear with the carotenoid axis and adjacent to the \u03b22-ring, features the fully conserved L37, M83, M117 and I125 (Supplementary Figures 7, 8 and 9) at its bottleneck and encompasses the binding site of the carotenoid in the structure of the isolated NTD of Syn-OCPCAN (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). Channel #1 is opened in all Ntag-Plankto-OCP structures, and as well in all previously determined OCP structures. In the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structure, however, the presence of two alternate main-chain conformations for \u03b1G-\u03b1H loop residues 120-GIAPIPSGYKL-131 (Supplementary Figure S6) results in two configurations of the channel (see Supplementary Table S4) characterized by either a wider or narrower opening (Supplementary Figures 6, 8 and 9). The enlargement of channel #1 is compulsory for the carotenoid to translocate fully across the NTD, as illustrated by the observation that the \u03b1G-\u03b1H loop displays a large change in conformation in the structure of the isolated NTD of Syn-OCPCAN, compared to the NTD in dark-adapted Syn-OCPOCAN (Figure 13B) [21]. Hence the two C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN conformers offer an illustration of how structural dynamics in the \u03b1G-\u03b1H loop may participate in the regulation of photoactivation. We yet note that none of the conformations observed in our various Ntag-Plankto-OCP structures, or in the previously determined OCP structures, matches that found in the structure of the isolated NTD of Syn-OCPCAN.", "figure_ref": ["fig11", "fig11", "fig13", "fig13"], "table_ref": []}, "b4d9a202-9a19-4bff-8193-d139338c2433": {"text": "The second (#2), third (#3) and fourth channel (#4) are all perpendicular to the carotenoid tunnel, and open on either side of Y44 side chain, ending up just above the \u03b22-ring of the carotenoid (#2) or its second terpene unit (#3, #4) (Supplementary Figures 7 and 8). Channel #2 features W41 and Y44 at its bottleneck, whereas channel #3 is lined by Y44, M47, I51, I151 and F280, and channel #4 by Y44, Y111 and \u03b1G (Supplementary Figures 7 and 8). Residues W41, M47, I151 and M280 are strictly conserved, whereas V53 and I53 fill the structural position of Plankto-OCP I51 in Ana-OCP and Syn-OCP, respectively, and Y44 and Y111 are replaced by a phenylalanine (F44) and an asparagine (N111), respectively, in Ana-OCP. We find that channel #2 is opened toward the bulk in all P21 structures, albeit a much wider opening is observed in chain A of the P21 Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structure, due to a large swing of Y44 towards Y111 (Supplementary Figure 8) \u2013 i.e. away from W41. Of note, Y44 is found in alternate side-chain conformations in the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN structure, and as well in the previously determined Syn-OCPECN structure (Supplementary Figure 8). Additionally, channel #3 is opened in chain A of the P21 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN and Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structures, although in only one alternate conformer due to alternate conformations in M47. In both C2 structures, channel #2 and #3 are closed. Nonetheless, in one of the two alternate conformers of the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPCAN structure, channel #4 is opened (Supplementary Figure 7). We note that all previously determined OCP structures feature similar openings of the carotenoid tunnel towards the bulk that are perpendicular to the carotenoid axis. For example, channels #3 and #4 are opened in the Syn-OCP structures (PDB ids: 3mg1 and 4xb5), while channels #2 and channel #3 are opened in the Tolypothrix OCP structure (PDB id: 6pq1) and in the two chains of the asymmetric unit dimer from the Arthrospira structure (PDB id: 5ui2; also referred to as Limnospira). In Tolypothrix OCP, a supplementary channel (#5) is observed, ~ 180\u00b0 apart from channel #2, which is lined by the highly conserved F28, I40, S157 and M161 (Supplementary Figure 10). The opening of channel #5, which alike channel #2 ends up above the \u03b22-ring of the carotenoid albeit from the other side of the tunnel, mainly depends on the side chain conformation of M161 in the Tolypothrix OCP structure. Channel #5 is also opened in the two chains of the asymmetric unit dimer from the Anabaena OCP structure (PDB id: 5hgr), where its opening if facilitated by the substitution of I40 (in Plankto-OCP, Syn-OCP, Arthrospira and Tolypothrix OCPs) for a valine \u2013 atop the conformational change in M161. Channel #3 is additionally opened in chain B of Ana-OCP, but closed in chain A due to change in the conformation of M47. Thus, the Ntag-Plankto-OCP structures illustrate that the opening of channel #1-4 mainly depends on the conformations displayed by residues in \u03b1C (A33-E46) and in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D (M47-G57) and \u03b1G-\u03b1H (G120-L131) loops. The Tolypothrix and Anabaena OCP structures additionally reveal the existence of another channel (#5), which ends up on the side of the carotenoid \u03b22 ring where the methyl or carbonyl oxygen atom of ECN and CAN are exposed, respectively.

At position 288, a methionine is found in Plankto-OCP, Ana-OCP (PDB id: 5hgr) and Tolypothrix (PDB id: 6pq1)) OCP (PDB id: 4xb5), which is substituted for by an isoleucine in Synechocystis (I286) and Arthrospira OCP (I288) (Supplementary Figures 5, 6, 10). Thus, Plankto-OCP is particularly enriched in methionine residues. Of these two substitutions, we speculate that the one which may be related to the higher photoactivation rate of OCP is the former, since the slower Tolypothrix and Anabaena OCP also feature a methionine at position 288. Conversely, only Plankto-OCP features a methionine at position 207. The only other structural difference between the carotenoid tunnels of Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP is the placement of Plankto-OCP I51 at the position occupied by Syn-OCP I53, due to changes in the sequence of the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop (47-MGKTITVAALGAA-59 in Plankto-OCP vs. 47-MGKTLTIAAPGAA-59 in Syn-OCP) which adopts the same conformation in Syn-OCP, Ana-OCP, Arthro-OCP and Toply-OCP structures, but exhibits varying conformations in the various Ntag-Plankto-OCP structures (Supplementary Figures 10 and 12).

Such a fast thermal recovery had thus far been observed only for OCP2 and OCPX variants, but not for members of the OCP1 clade. Indeed, Synechocystis, Arthrospira and Tolypothrix OCP1 are all characterized by a slow recovery at 9\u00b0C. Similar to these, the recovery of Plankto-OCP can be further accelerated by addition of FRP, confirming its appartenance to the OCP1 clade. In previous studies, it was found that slow recovery and the ability to bind to FRP coincide in the OCP1 clade, as opposed to OCP2 and OCPX [16] which recover faster thermally but are unable to bind FRP. Based on sequence alignments, it was further suggested that the defining feature of the OCP1 clade is the presence of residues R229 and D262 (Synechocystis number), which are absent in OCP2 and OCPX [16]. Our data confirm that presence of R229 and D262 correlates with the ability to bind FRP, but indicate that the slow recovery rate of Synechocystis, Arthrospira and Tolypothrix OCP1 is unrelated to their presence.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "28c7a3bc-15aa-4989-b5e9-0f3281d0509e": {"text": "The faster photoactivation and recovery of Plankto-OCP could stem from its higher protein flexibility, illustrated by the large structural diversity amongst Plankto-OCP crystalline structures.

The Plankto-OCP structures offer a peek into the molecular breathing motions that animate OCP, at the monomer and the dimer levels. The P21 structures demonstrate that the two monomers in a dimer can adopt slightly different structures, differing in the opening angle at the NTD/CTD interface, and consequently, in the orientation of the carotenoid in the tunnel. These differences could account for the repeated observations that two types of OCP coexist in darkness in spectroscopic experiments [40]. The conformations present in the C2 structures match best those displayed by chain B in the P21 structures. Nonetheless, they are not strictly equivalent, differing not only in the opening angle at the NTD/CTD interface, but as well in the exact positioning of helices around the carotenoid and in the conformation displayed by the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops.

Together, the six chains illustrate that the opening of channels #1-4 mainly depends on the conformations displayed by residues in \u03b1C (A33-E46; channels 1-2) and in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D (M47-G57; channels 2-4) and \u03b1G-\u03b1H (G120-L131; channel 1) loops, and question the possible role of water access to the carotenoid tunnel in the photoactivation mechanism \u2013 and/or its limitation. The enlargement of channel #1 is compulsory for the carotenoid to translocate fully across the NTD, and accordingly, the \u03b1G-\u03b1H loop displays a large change in conformation in the isolated NTD of Syn-OCPCAN, as compared to the NTD in dark-adapted Syn-OCPOCAN [21] (Figure 13). Two alternate conformations are observed for this loop in the C2 Ntag-Plankto-OCPECN structure, which offer an illustration of how structural dynamics could participate in the regulation of photoactivation. We yet note that none of the conformations observed in our various Ntag-Plankto-OCP structures, or in the previously determined OCP structures, matches that found in the structure of the isolated NTD of Syn-OCPCAN [21]. We also investigated if the presence of multiple alternate conformations could underlie the higher photoactivity of Plankto-OCP. Plotting these against the secondary (Figure 9A and Supplementary Table S2) or tertiary structure, we identify the \u03b1C-\u03b1D (M47-G57) loop, \u03b1M and \u03b24 as clusters, i.e. secondary-structure elements or epitopes more prone to alternate conformations irrespective of the space group or functionalizing carotenoid (Figure 9A). W288, at the CTD end of the carotenoid tunnel, is present in alternate conformations in all structures. Additionally, D6, N14, Q73, Q77, M117, M207, R241, R244, V258, K275 are present in alternate conformations in at three out of the six Plankto-OCP chains analyzed. In conclusion, we propose that the structural traits which explain the higher photoactivation rate of Plankto-OCP are the increased flexibility in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D (M47-G57) and \u03b1G-\u03b1H (G120-L131) loops, which results in opening of water channels to the carotenoid tunnel, and increased molecular breathing motions at the levels of the dimer, the NTD/CTD interface, and the NTD helix core. As to the increased recovery rate, we hypothesize that it originates from a decreased stabilization of the Plankto-OCPR state. Hence, we first compared residues distribution along the carotenoid tunnel in the NTD. The only structural difference between the NTD tunnels of Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP is the placement of Plankto-OCP I51 at the position occupied by Syn-OCP I53, due to changes in the sequence of the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop (47-MGKTITVAALGAA-59 in Plankto-OCP vs. 47-MGKTLTIAAPGAA-59 in Syn-OCP) (Supplementary Figures 5, 6 and 10). Another, more hypothetical means by which the Plankto-OCPR state would be rendered less stable could be through a decrease in the affinity of the CTT for the empty CTD tunnel. Syn-OCP is unique among the variants discussed herein in that it features a 314-NFAR-317 sequence at its C-terminus instead of 316-NLVR-319 in the other OCP (Supplementary Figure 10). The combined substitution of a leucine for phenylalanine, and of a valine for alanine, could account for a higher affinity of the Syn-OCP CTT for the empty CTD tunnel. Reversely, the presence in Plankto-OCP of a methionine at position 288, (Planktothrix numeration) instead of an isoleucine at position 286 in Syn-OCP, could decrease the affinity of the Plankto-OCP CTT for the empty CTD tunnel.", "figure_ref": ["fig13", "fig9", "fig9"], "table_ref": []}, "bc6a5a54-f4bd-4722-ab0a-73e3710c5072": {"text": "We also further examined the effect of His-tagging at the N- or C-terminus on the various functional properties of OCP (Figures 3 and 8). Indeed, both the NTE and the CTT have been proposed to play important roles in the OCP photoactivation and recovery mechanisms. We found that irrespectively of the variant, the N-tagged protein displays the best match to the native protein, both in terms of photoactivation rate and thermal recovery rate. Native Syn-OCP and Plankto-OCP display the fastest photoactivation profile, indicating that increased disorder in their NTE or a weaker interaction between the NTE and CTD does not benefit photoactivation as was previously suggested [61]. Recovery was also found to be faster in native Syn-OCP and Plankto-OCP than in their His-tagged counterparts. A dramatic drop in the recovery rate was notably observed for the C-tagged Plankto-OCP, which could stem either from a higher stability of the OCPR state in presence of a C-terminal His-tag or from a frustrated recovery of the OCPO state due to hindered rebinding of the CTT to the CTD \u03b2-sheet. Regardless, these results point to an important role played by the CTT in the OCPR to OCPO recovery. Little is known regarding the configuration of the CTT residues in the OCPR state and its role in OCP photoactivation and recovery. However, it was shown that in the Synechocystis C-terminal domain homologue (CTDH), which belongs to a family of carotenoid-transporting proteins homologous to the OCP CTD [35, 36], the CTT can exchange between a closed conformation, whereby it covers the empty carotenoid tunnel, and an opened conformation, similar to that observed in OCPO. By analogy, it was proposed that one of the last steps of OCP photoactivation is the repositioning of the CTT on the empty CTD-half of the carotenoid tunnel. Presence of a six-histidine tag in the CTT could hinder this movement, leading to slower kinetics of photoactivation and recovery. In conclusion, our results suggest that re-binding to the CTD \u03b2-sheet of the CTT, and to a lower extent of the NTE, are rate limiting steps in the thermal recovery of the OCPO state, and that completion of these steps is inhibited by presence of a His-tag at their C or N-terminal extremities, respectively.", "figure_ref": ["fig3", "fig8"], "table_ref": []}, "e55e3e70-0437-4861-8528-e8f5e8e3f067": {"text": "The position of the His-tag also influences the PBS quenching, with again a more pronounced effect of His-tagging at the C-terminus than at the N-terminus of OCP. In the past, we proposed that the presence of a six-histidine tag upstream the NTE could destabilize the interaction with the PBS [61], yet the present data invalidate the hypothesis, demonstrating that N-tagged and native OCP detach as swiftly from the PBS. Contrastingly, introduction of the six-histidine tag downstream the CTT results in increased PBS-fluorescence quenching and slower fluorescence recovery. This result can be rationalized by envisioning that the C-terminal his-tag strongly stabilizes the PBS-bound OCPR structure, possibly through interaction of the tag with PBS amino acids. A cross-species characterization of OCP/PBS complexes allowed the discovery that irrespective of His-tagging, Plankto-OCP binds stronger to Syn-PBS than Syn-OCP. Furthermore, Plankto-OCP binds stronger to Syn-PBS than to Plankto-PBS, echoing the previous observation that Arthrospira and Anabaena OCPs bind stronger to Syn-PBS than to Arthrospira and Anabaena PBS, respectively [42]. Recent studies on Syn-OCP have shown that besides R155, early demonstrated as compulsory for the OCP/PBS interaction [62], residues L51, P56, G57, A58, N104, I151, and N156 play important roles in the interaction [63]. Recall that in all OCP, N104 and R155 are involved in the stabilization of the OCPO state by contributing H-bonds to the NTD/CTD interface (N104(OD1) to W277(Syn)/W279 (Plankto)(NE1); R155(NH2) to E244 (Syn)/E246 (Plankto)(OE1)). In addition, in all structures but the Plankto-OCP structures, N104 contributes to the stabilization of the linker by establishing a H-bond to E174(OE1). As G57, N104, I151, R155 and N156 are structurally conserved in Plankto-OCP, one can eliminate the hypothesis that the observed differences in Syn-PBS quenching would stem from these. As to Syn-OCP L51, it is replaced by an isoleucine in the Anabaena, Limnospira and Tolypothrix proteins, nonetheless the side chain occupies the same position in all structures, fitting in a groove contributed by M47, I151, F280 and V284, at the NTD-CTD interface. In Plankto-OCP, this residue is conserved; however, due to changes in the sequence of the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop (47-MGKTITVAALGAA-59 in Plankto-OCP vs. 47-MGKTLTIAAPGAA-59 in Syn-OCP), Plankto-OCP L51 is found at the position occupied by I53 in all previously-determined OCP structures. Syn-OCP P56 is replaced by a leucine in Plankto-OCP, but it is conserved in other OCPs. Hence, the difference in PBS binding-affinity and fluorescence-quenching observed between Syn-OCP and Plankto-OCP could stem from changes in the sequence and structure of the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop. Within 4 \u00c5 of R155, supposedly central to the interaction, we find four additional candidate positions at which residue substitutions could explain the higher affinity of Plankto-OCP as compared to Syn-OCP: G99, T102, A103 and C157, respectively. These residues are substituted by A99, S102, P103 and A157 in Syn-OCP, and by A99, S102, P103 and S157 in Ana-OCP. Future mutagenesis work concentrated on these results could unveil the molecular basis for this unexpected cross-species preference for the Syn-PBS. Specific to the lower affinity of Plankto-OCP for Plankto-PBS than Syn-PBS, it must be recalled that OCP binding to the PBS is very sensitive to the structural intactness of the PBS core. Although 77K fluorescence spectra of both isolated PBS suggested a perfect energy transfer from PC to the last core emitters, we cannot discard the hypothesis that a slightly different interaction between the APC trimers could be at the origin of the weaker OCP-PBS binding observed for Arthrospira and Planktothrix species-specific complexes. It was also observed that the Plankto-Lcm protein is more sensitive to proteolysis than Syn-Lcm (Supplementary Figure 3). Hence the reduced affinity of Plankto-OCP for the Plankto-PBS could originate in the partial degradation of the Lcm component.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "ec2e459e-c52d-4dab-9856-5c9c2e54ee78": {"text": "We last examined the influence of the functionalizing carotenoid on OCP excited and intermediate states dynamics. Indeed, irrespective of the species, CAN-functionalized OCP photoactivates faster and recovers slower than ECN-functionalized OCP. Using fs-ns and ns-s transient absorption spectroscopy on ECN- and CAN-functionalized Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP, we inquired the time scale(s) on which the gain in photoactivation efficiency occurs for the CAN-functionalized proteins. We observed differences in the respective yields of the S1, ICT and S* states, but nearly no change in their characteristic lifetimes nor in the P1 yield (Table 1). Hence, the difference in photoactivation rate of ECN- and CAN-functionalized OCP does not stem from changes in their excited state dynamics nor in the P1 formation quantum yield. Furthermore, the increased S* yield observed for CAN-functionalized Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP is not mirrored by an increase in the P1 yield, suggesting that the former is not its only precursor. Clear differences between the four tested OCPs were yet observed in the ns-s time scale. First, we observed for Plankto-OCP a larger drop in difference absorption at 563 nm on the ns-\u00b5s time scale, which could sign for a sub-optimal translocation of ECN and CAN into the Plankto-NTD, as compared to the Syn-NTD. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that ECN-functionalized OCP forms more compact monomers and dimers, wherein migration of the carotenoid could be facilitated (Figures 12 and 13). Regardless, the most striking differences between Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP are visible in the ns-ms time window, while those between CAN- and ECN-functionalized OCP concentrate in the ms-s timescale. Thus, our results suggest that both carotenoid translocation and NTE/CTT detachments are affected by the change in protein scaffold, whereas it is domain dissociation that is most affected by a change in the functionalizing carotenoid. Our data support that domain dissociation is faster and more efficient in CAN-functionalized OCPs, with no decline observed in the difference absorption at 550 nm. Specific to Plankto-OCPCAN, a faster domain separation is observed with virtually no recovery to OCPO on the \u00b5s-s timescale (100% efficiency from P3 to final OCPR). The increased photoactivation rate of Plankto-CAN is likely grounded in this property. Thus, the differences observed in the photoactivation speed of CAN- and ECN-functionalized Plankto-OCP and Syn-OCP stem from changes in the (comparatively-slow) carotenoid translocation, NTE/CTT detachment and domain dissociation steps \u2013 rather than from not changes in the excited-state dynamics or P1 formation quantum yield.", "figure_ref": ["fig12", "fig13"], "table_ref": ["tbl1"]}, "74d51ba3-17e3-493a-901c-4fe8c1f60780": {"text": "It remains unclear whether or not canthaxanthin can be generally used as a functionalizing carotenoid for OCP in the natural context. When expressed in their parent strain, Arthrospira and Synechocystis OCPs [8, 11] bind hECN, while Tolypothrix OCP1 binds CAN [30]. Recombinant expression of Arthrospira and Anabaena OCPs in Synechocystis cells also yield an hECN-functionalized proteins [32, 42]. Yet, when overexpressed and isolated from CAN-producing E. coli cells, all these OCPs bind CAN, suggesting that OCPs may alternatively bind hECN or CAN depending on the carotenoid presents in the cells. We earlier reported the partial inability of Anabaena and Tolypothrix OCP to fully convert to OCPR, when functionalized by ECN [8, 11]. Here, thermal recovery kinetics were found to be slower in the CAN-functionalized Syn- and Plankto-OCPs, possibly due to a reduced stabilization of the OCPR state by ECN, as compared to CAN. Assuming that the \u03b2-rings of the carotenoid are exposed to the bulk in the OCPR state, as suggested by the structure of the CAN-functionalized isolated NTD of Syn-OCP (PDB id: 4xb4; [21]), the higher stability of the CAN-functionalized OCPR could result from the presence of an oxygen on its \u03b22 ring, favoring interaction with the bulk. A similar stability would thus be expected for hECN, which features a hydroxyl group in the \u03b22-ring. Hence, the possibility remains that all OCPs bind hECN in their parent strain. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that quenching by Plankto-OCP of the Plankto-PBS fluorescence is efficient only when ECN is used as the functionalizing carotenoid (or when the protein is tagged at the C-terminus). This result incidentally suggests that in the Planktothrix cells, the carotenoid functionalizing OCP is not CAN.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "8095bf59-8c99-4b65-b2af-af56fc4ab998": {"text": "It is difficult to rationalize the observation that CAN-OCP interaction with the PBS is weaker than that with ECN-OCP (Figures 7 and 8, and Supplementary Figure 11). These results are at variance with the observation that CAN stabilizes the OCPR state, and suggest that the isolated OCPR and PBS-bound-OCPR structures could differ. The sole difference between CAN- and ECN-functionalized OCPR is the presence of a carbonyl oxygen on the \u03b22-ring, but this difference should not affect binding to the PBS, since its epitope has been mapped at the opposite end of the carotenoid tunnel in the NTD, proximate to R155. Thus, it is presumably the \u03b21-ring, identical in CAN and ECN, which will be in contact with the PBS. A possible explanation could be that upon OCP binding to PBS, the carotenoid migrates into to the PBS, enabling a better interaction with the bilin pigments, as proposed earlier [21, 64]. If it is the \u03b21-ring that plunges into the PBS \u2013 i.e., the carotenoid moves backwards with respect to the OCPO to OCPR transition \u2013 then the \u03b22-ring will be repositioned inside the highly hydrophobic carotenoid tunnel, possibly past its original position in the OCPO structure, which would explain the reduced stability of the CAN-functionalized OCP-PBS complexes, due to replacement of a methyl in ECN by a carbonyl oxygen in CAN. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that the isolated and PBS-bound OCPR differ. If true, OCP-related quenching of PBS-fluorescence would be a two-step reaction (at the very least), with first the binding of OCPR to PBS, and then a change in the OCPR structure \u2013 as initially proposed by [21, 64].", "figure_ref": ["fig7", "fig8"], "table_ref": []}, "c9a5c5d4-4cb2-4f3c-bf6f-623207c56042": {"text": "We here have reported on a comparative structure-function study on two OCPs from the OCP1 clade, i.e., Syn-OCP and Plankto-OCP. Our results suggest that Plankto-OCP is more flexible and we speculate that this increase in flexibility explains its faster photoactivation and recovery. Specifically, our Plankto-OCP structures evidence increased structural dynamics in the \u03b1C-\u03b1D loop, which was shown to have a central role in the interaction between OCPR and PBS [62\u201364]. Increased dynamics in this loop could be at the origin of the stronger binding of Plankto-OCP (compared to Syn-OCP) to Syn-PBS. Irrespectively, our data point to more efficient carotenoid translocation and NTE/CTT detachments in Plankto-OCP. We also show that presence of a His-tag influences both the photocycle of OCP (see also Nizinski et al., submitted; doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.26.474187) and its interaction with the PBS. Most impacting is introduction of the tag at the C-terminus, which results in both large damping of the photoactivation and recovery and in stronger binding to the PBS, suggesting an important role for the CTT in these molecular processes, The CTT has been proposed to shift from open position in OCPO (in which the CTT interacts with the CTD) to a close position in OCPR (in which the CTT presumably binds in the carotenoid tunnel); our results are also suggestive of an involvement of the CTT in PBS binding. Our work last uncovers the strong influence of the nature of the functionalizing carotenoid on all aspects of OCP function. The mere substitution on ring \u03b22 of a dimethyl in ECN by a carbonyl in CAN results in increased photoactivation efficiency, which our ns-s spectroscopic data suggest to be due to faster domain dissociation. Nonetheless, CAN-functionalized OCP display reduced recovery, reduced binding to PBS and reduced energy-quenching activity.

Most mosses exhibit leaf-curling when dry, a mechanism that may reduce direct sunlight on leaf lamina [12,13]. Many desert mosses also have translucent leaf cells at the tips of their leaves, some even extending into long, hyaline awns, possibly reducing solar absorbance by increasing reflectance [12\u201314]. Furthermore, some mosses accumulate pigments such as carotenoids, anthocyanins, and UV-absorbing compounds such as flavonoids that may act as passive sunscreens [15\u201319].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "9bed7716-e305-46f8-83ec-90c7354e9630": {"text": "Hypoliths are organisms that live under and on the belowground surface of translucent and opaque stones (typically quartz) that are embedded in the soil surface [20].

Hypolithic mosses experience much lower light intensity than mosses on the soil surface, less than 4% of surface light intensity. Previous studies have found an average range of 50-99% of ambient PAR intensity reaching hypolithic spaces [25,28,45,46]. At the low end, Beer\u2019s Law extrapolation from integrating sphere measurements of light transmittance through Mojave Desert quartz pebbles finds an average of just 1.18% light transmittance for all 18 quartz rocks that harbored hypolithic mosses in this study [33]. On the other hand, lower light intensity could also be a benefit, even to photosynthetic organisms such as mosses, by way of reduction of photobleaching and energy burden to dissipate excess light [47]. Light transmission through Mojave milky quartz is relatively constant across the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum but increases slightly from 390 nm wavelengths to 1090 nm wavelengths (approximately the upper limit of ultraviolet light to the upper limit of infrared light). This suggests the possibility that not only is the hypolithic space a refuge from overall high light intensity but that hypoliths also experience a smaller proportion of damaging UV light relative to photosynthetically active radiation [47]. In fact, there is evidence that nearly all UV-A and UV-B radiation is filtered out before reaching hypolithic communities [25,28]. Syntrichia caninervis develops a dark brown or black coloration in natural environments, a phenotypically plastic trait that does not occur in low-light laboratory conditions and may represent a UV sunscreen. This pigmentation was reduced or absent in quartz hypolithic microhabitats, possibly caused by the drastically different light environment. Interestingly, UV-B tolerance in mosses seems to correlate with desiccation tolerance [48] and S. caninervis, being one of the most desiccation-tolerant plants known, may also be expected to have high UV tolerance, too. Indeed, a close relative of this species, the also highly desiccation-tolerant S. ruralis, is not damaged by UV-B radiation, at least based on chlorophyll fluorescence [48].", "figure_ref": ["fig3", "fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "29fc3a3e-4a8e-4afa-97a2-46f22aca7f94": {"text": "Hypolithic S. caninervis plants may also be growing more, and thus have longer shoots, due to increased moisture retention resulting in an extended growing season relative to the adjacent soil surface [21] (Table 1). In this study, the area under quartz rocks was moist to the touch and the mosses were hydrated two weeks post-rain (assessed May 11, 2014; 0.51 mm rain at nearby Palmdale Airport on April 26, 2014; month-to-date rain: 10.9 mm). Microclimate monitoring found the soil surface to have a mean daily low RH much lower than in the adjacent hypolithic microhabitat (Table 1). Furthermore, we saw strong seasonal effects in RH differences between the microhabitats. In the warmer months, differences were smaller in magnitude and varied diurnally, with daytime having higher RH under quartz and night having higher RH on the soil surface. However, in winter the quartz hypolithic microhabitat almost always had higher RH than the soil surface. These data suggest the hypolithic spaces may act as a buffer to desiccation due to reduced evapotranspiration [27,49]. In contrast, desert soil surface mosses may desiccate within a day after a rainfall [50,51], even in as few as three hours [52]. The longest reported hydroperiod (time of complete hydration) for a Mojave Desert moss is 17 days, though most range between 1 and 4 days [52]. We found that nearly half of the monitoring period, the RH of hypolithic microhabitat was more than 10% higher than the soil surface, suggesting hypolithic mosses may be able take advantage of longer hydroperiods with more favorable RH. Indeed, hypolithic mosses receive very little light and would presumably need longer hydroperiods in order to take advantage of it. Longer hydroperiods not only allow mosses to remain photosynthetically active for a longer period of time, but overly brief periods of water availability may actually cause damage to desert mosses in the form of respiratory carbon deficit [53]. Similarly, soil moisture is higher under quartz in Antarctica [54], due in part to the tendency of meltwater draining around the edges of rocks and exposure of surface soil to wind drying [26].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tbl1", "tbl1"]}, "d5ca5344-3ad9-41de-a1bd-61953389dac2": {"text": "Hypolithic microhabitats may also be providing refuge from extreme temperature fluctuations that are common in the Mojave Desert.

However, in at least one case, lower temperatures were reported under quartz rocks [26]. These apparently conflicting results may be due to thermal inertia of the rocks causing a lag in temperature changes [26].

When diazotrophic activity is present in hypoliths, it is generally accomplished by Proteobacteria [57].

Tortula inermis typically occurs at lower elevations of the Mojave Desert than S. caninervis, which suggests that this species is adapted to hotter and drier conditions than S. caninervis [50]. In our study, T. inermis was much more likely to occupy protected hypolithic spaces than exposed surface conditions (Table 2). This finding, while initially counterintuitive, may highlight the importance of interactions between both temperature stress and moisture availability in controlling the distribution of this species. Dryland mosses are photosynthetically efficient at low light levels, which tend to prevail in winter months when populations are hydrated [60] and overcast conditions are ideal for growth [61]. At the elevation of our study site, these periods when mosses are metabolically active are also accompanied by extreme low temperatures and significant snowfall events. Two such events occurred during our microenvironmental monitoring (Nov. 27, 2019 for 8 days and Dec. 25, 2019 for 10 days). These periods when snow covered the soil surface are evidenced by a constant difference in the temperature and RH readings from hypoliths and the soil surface, with hypoliths maintaining the same RH and a slightly warmer temperature than the surface (Figs. 2-3). Thus, at our study site, T. inermis, which is typically found at lower (i.e., warmer) elevations, may benefit from the thermal protection that hypolithic spaces provide during the growing season, and its prevalence in hypoliths may reflect lower levels of cold stress tolerance compared to S. caninervis. Although specific composition differed in the soil surface and quartz hypolithic microhabitats, S. caninervis was abundant in both. This pattern of distinct but overlapping communities in soil surface and hypolithic microhabitats has been found in other studies of hypolithic microbial systems [55,62].

In the model, the cell\u2019s mechanical stability prevents overturning by the weaker eddies (Figs. 1E, S1B, S2A), thus creating resting times between periods during which the cell is overturned (Figs. 3A, S2B,C). Accordingly, a cell accumulates ROS whenever it is tumbled by an eddy, and dissipates stress by means of its intracellular antioxidant capacity (), with a characteristic dissipation timescale \u03c4S (see Methods, Eqs. 3 and 4). We quantified stress dissipation dynamics and the timescale \u03c4S experimentally by observing the reduction of ROS over time for cells after exposure to continuous rolling for 5 min (\u03a9 = 1 rad s\u22121). These experiments showed that stress decays exponentially over time with a timescale \u03c4S = 87 \u00b1 32 s (Fig. 3B).

Our results demonstrate that the overturning of cells, a fundamental yet to date unappreciated mechanical cue due to turbulence in the ocean, can trigger behavioral and physiological responses over timescales spanning tens of seconds to multiple generations. The good agreement between our model and observations suggests that motile phytoplankton use mechanical stability to sense the intensity of turbulent cues and integrate these cues in time via ROS signaling: when ROS accumulates beyond a threshold, it triggers the switch in migratory behavior. This ROS-mediated early warning strategy may be advantageous owing to the heterogeneity in mechanical stability within monoclonal populations (Fig. 1C).

An effect of rotation is that the gravitational acceleration g appears to be rotating in the rotating frame of reference. During a tumbling event, intracellular stress is generated in the cell under the form of a nearly instantaneous release (i.e., a spike) of ROS whenever the cell is being reoriented relatively to gravity, that is, when the cell experiences an impulsive force of typical magnitude Fg ~ 1 pN (see SI). In our model, the ROS spike specifically occurs at times t whenever the cell swims in a direction \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, that is in the direction perpendicular to the gravity vector. This particular choice of swimming direction is arbitrary, and we could choose any value between \u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 without changing our results. The intracellular scavenging machinery of the cells dissipates the accumulated stress s with a characteristic timescale, \u03c4S (measured experimentally, Fig. 3B; see SI).

Hence, the rapid elevations of transcripts encoding the photoprotective proteins during a dark to light transition might serve to prime the cells for a marked increase in radiation that occurs during the first few hours of light in the morning. Levels of transcripts from LHCSR1, LHCSR3.1 and PSBS1 genes were analyzed in dark-acclimated wild type (WT) cells (the WT is CC125 unless otherwise stated) after exposure to 1 h of PAR at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 960 \u00b5mol photons m-2 s-1.

Interestingly, the PHOT1 dependent increase in LHCSR3.1 transcript abundance was strongly suppressed by high CO2 (), which raises the possibility that the PHOT1-dependent regulation might be an indirect effect caused by a reduction in the CO2 levels.

While the transcript levels of the qE related genes are extremely low and the proteins are absent in dark-acclimated cells, their induction must anticipate HL exposure to minimize cellular damage. In this work, we analyzed how photosynthetic cells sense and integrate environmental cues to modulate expression of the photoprotective genes LHCSR1, LHCSR3.1 and PSBS1, and the adaptation mechanisms that they have incorporated for coping with light stress prior to accumulation of the encoded proteins. We show that illumination with even very LL was sufficient to cause substantial accumulation of transcripts from the photoprotective genes in dark pre-acclimated cells (). This LL induction was mainly mediated by blue light and required PHOT1 as cells deficient in PHOT1 exhibited a marked reduction in accumulation of LHCSR1, LHCSR3.1 and PSBS1 transcripts (), as it has been shown before via RT-PCR (Aihara et al., 2019). Thus, at dawn, with the first low levels of sunlight, Chlamydomonas would induce the photoprotective genes. Sun light is blue light-enriched in aquatic environments, as shorter wavelengths in a water column have a higher penetrating capacity (Kirk, 1994). Furthermore, the proportion of the blue light in the visible spectrum reaching the Earth\u2019s surface increases from dawn to mid-day and decreases towards sunset.

While direct sunlight is shielded/reduced by canopy shading, blue light (and also UV light in the case of a plant canopy) reach shaded areas more effectively than other wavelength of PAR through Rayleigh scattering, which increases as the wavelength of light decreases. B) Signals that regulate energy dissipation in Chlamydomonas. Transcription of LHCSR1, LHCSR3 and PSBS is strongly initiated with exposure to a very low amount of white light (, 5 \u00b5mol photons m-2 s-1). This activation is strongest for LHCSR3 but also is also apparent for LHCSR1 and PSBS and is dependent on the Chlamydomonas blue light dependent photoreceptor PHOT1. All three transcripts are also partially regulated by PET downstream of PSII and the generation of retrograde signals by HL (red). UV-B exposure further regulates transcript induction on several levels. UV-B radiation directly facilitates monomerization of the UVR8 homodimer, which then binds to COP1 and allows the participation of other factors (not included in the figure) in the transcriptional regulation of the photoprotective genes (purple). UV-B exposure may also lead to the generation of RS in the chloroplast which further triggers signaling events (red). Additionally, LHCSR3 is strongly controlled by CO2 levels and the regulatory factor CIA5, which may function as an enhancer while PSBS may be affected by CO2 to a minor extent (orange).

In addition to PHOT1-mediated responses, our data suggest that other signals impact photoprotective gene induction in LL, but that the genes have different sensitivities to some of these signals. For example, LHCSR1 transcript levels exhibited a low but significant increase in the phot1 mutant when exposed to blue light (), reaching levels almost identical to those observed in red light-induced WT cells (). Similar behavior, although much less pronounced, was observed for LHCSR3.1 and PSBS1. This low level PHOT1-independent induction could be mediated either by signals generated as a consequence of electron flow in the chloroplast and/or by other photoreceptors such as cryptochromes (CRYs), which can be activated by both blue and red light (Beel et al., 2012). CRYs accumulates during the dark period of the diel cycle, and elicits activation of cellular processes after illumination (e.g., gametes formation, circadian regulation) (M\u00fcller et al., 2017). Moreover, they are required for LHCSX protein accumulation in diatoms (Juhas et al., 2014) linking CRYs and photoprotection in microalgae. Integration of CRY- and PHOT1-dependent pathways might enhance expression of the photoprotective genes. Furthermore, CRYs are also required for phytochrome signaling functions associated with the circadian clock in plants (Devlin & Kay, 2000). Although currently there are no identified phytochromes in Chlamydomonas, there are red light stimulated processes in this alga and it has the capacity to synthesize bilins (linear tetrapyrroles that often absorb red light), which may function as signaling molecules and control the biosynthesis of chlorophyll (Duanmu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2021). The Chlamydomonas genome also encodes proteins with potential bilin binding domains, like those of phytochromes.

Similarly, LHCSR1 was also mildly repressed by DCMU in LL.

Two photosynthesis inhibitors, DCMU, which promotes oxidation of the PQ pool, and DBMIB, which leads to overreduction of the PQ pool, inhibit LHCSR3 protein accumulation (Petroutsos, Busch, Jan\u00dfen, et al., 2011). Singlet oxygen production, which is mainly synthesized in the PSII antenna, should be enhanced in the presence of both inhibitors, suggesting that this RS most likely does not cause induction of the LHCSR3 or LHCSR1 genes. Furthermore, DBMIB blocks electron transport at the Qo site of the Cyt b complex. Therefore, the signal required for this electron transport-dependent induction of the photoprotective genes is likely generated downstream of the Qo site. Moreover, dark pre-acclimated cells are in state 2 (mobile PSII antenna associated with PSI) due to a reduction in intracellular oxygen levels associated with our experimental conditions (pre-acclimation in the dark without vigorous shaking) (Delepelaire & Wollman, 1985; Finazzi et al., 1999) and the cells would only gradually transition to state 1 in the light, because full activation of the CBBC can take 2-3 minutes (Makowka et al., 2020). Therefore, upon illumination, PSI can absorb more photons because of the larger size of its antenna, which might initially favor RS production because of the initial bottleneck in the CBBC. However, this bottleneck would be ameliorated by the action of the FLV proteins (Chaux et al., 2017) and a diminished supply of electrons from PSII (because of the reduced antennae size). Furthermore, blocking electron flow would prevent the fixation of CO2 and lead to an elevation of intracellular CO2 levels.

In HL, hypoxia and fermentation metabolism may become more prominent, the breakdown of starch and generation of NADH would increase, as would the generation of excited pigment molecules and RS, which could contribute to accumulation of the LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 transcripts. Our data suggests that transcription of LHCSR1 may be more sensitive to RS than LHCSR3, which is supported by previous findings (Roach et al., 2020); lower sensitivity of LHCSR3 expression to chloroplast-generated signals is also supported by the finding that of the three photoprotective genes, this gene required exposure to the highest light intensity (960 \u00b5mol photons m-2 s-1) for maximizing mRNA accumulation ().", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "dacb208b-61ee-482b-bb31-270da1ad6689": {"text": "The discussion above offers explanations for the different induction levels of LHCSR3 observed in light and dark pre-acclimated cells treated with DCMU (Supplemental Figure 3).

Additionally, UV-B-dependent induction could confer an advantage to the cells when they are under a canopy, which reduces the level of PAR relative to UV-B radiation (Hermanowicz et al., 2019).

In fact, it has been reported that under partly cloudy skies, UV-B radiation may increase in intensity by \u223c25% relative to clear skies (Mims & Frederick, 1994).

The clearest role of MYB24 in modulating light responses through carotenoids is observed with the carotenoid isomerase and the lycopene beta cyclase, highly induced in the white skin sections of variegated berries (Supplementary Figure S18A). LCYE produces alpha-carotene from lycopene and is the first committed step in the production of lutein, the most abundant carotenoid (xanthophyll) in photosynthetic plant tissues where it plays important roles in light-harvesting complex-II structure and function (68, 69). In the second place, MYB24 may also regulate the production of volatile benzenoids. In petunia, its homologues EMISSION OF BENZENOIDS I/II (EOBI/II) regulate the expression of eugenol synthases (IGS) and an ABCG1 transporter leading to the accumulation of eugenol/isoeugenol, two VOCs belonging to the phenylpropanoid pathway that is emitted at night as part of the floral scent bouquet of petunias to attract pollinators (70\u201373).

Melanogenesis is a complex, multi-step process that begins with the non-essential amino acid L-tyrosine and results in the production of mostly insoluble eumelanin (brown-black) or pheomelanin (red-yellow) polymers. Variation in the eumelanin to pheomelanin ratio creates the natural diversity in human skin pigmentation. These baseline pigmentary differences result from numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in at least 200 genes involved in melanin synthesis. Eumelanin acts as a physical photoprotective filter against DNA damaging solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and thereby protects skin cells from deleterious mutations that may lead to malignant transformation. While melanin\u2019s UVR shielding effect undoubtedly accounts for some of the differences in lifetime melanoma risk across the diverse human pigment continuum, highly pigmented skin provides a sun protective factor (SPF) of only 2-3 versus lightly pigmented skin, which seems insufficient to completely explain the large 30-fold difference in skin cancer incidence between people with lightly pigmented vs darkly pigmented skin. Furthermore, a UVR shielding effect does not fully explain decades of epidemiologic data suggesting that there are UV-independent determinants of melanoma risk that also correlate with skin pigment type. Melanomas arising in completely sun-protected areas, such as anorectal melanoma, are up to 13 times more common in people with lightly vs highly pigmented skin. There is also an intriguing observation involving skin cancer in people from Africa with albinism. While affected individuals have epidermal MCs, they do not make melanin, and therefore have white or extremely lightly pigmented skin and hair. They exhibit photosensitivity and an expected elevated incidence of keratinocyte-derived cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. However, they appear highly resistant to melanoma suggesting that while their MCs are visibly light, they may be functionally \u201cdark\u201d with regard to melanoma, and thereby similar to those with darkly pigmented skin in their population group with shared African ancestry.

Compared to the largely planktonic group of centric diatoms, the predominantly benthic and evolutionary younger pennate diatoms are far more species-rich [7]. This remarkable diversification is especially pronounced among the raphid pennates, being attributed to their heterothallic mating systems and active cell motility. Heterothally (differentiation in two or more mating types, as opposed to homothally in most centrics) promotes outcrossing, generating high levels of genetic diversity. Diatom cell motility, which is thought to be driven by an intracellular actomyosin cytoskeletal motor system linked to adhesive mucilage secretions from a cell wall slit termed the raphe, allows active positioning along chemical and physical microgradients within or on submerged surfaces. Importantly, motility of gametangial cells or gametes enables pheromone-guided mate finding, thus optimizing encounter success between opposite mating types in highly diverse and densely packed biofilms [8].

The observation that 63% of the S. robusta dispensable genes in the reference genome are expressed and several of these encode for transporters and metabolic proteins indicates this genomic variation represents transcriptionally active genes, potentially offering a template for phenotypic or physiological evolution in this diatom.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "c613ef6d-eba5-4758-b4d5-5c4c8acf4df0": {"text": "To evaluate conservation at the amino acid level and identify S. robusta genes that are under positive or purifying selection, we further used the re-sequencing strains to generate a high-confidence coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset (see Supplementary Note S5). The average estimates of nucleotide diversity at nonsynonymous (\u03c0N) and synonymous (\u03c0S) sites are 0.003 and 0.022 respectively. This indicates that two homologous sequences drawn at random from different strains will on average differ by 2.2% on synonymous sites and 0.3% on non-synonymous sites. The average \u03c0N / \u03c0S ratio is 0.14, which is smaller than what has been reported in other organisms such as O. tauri (0.20) [34], C. reinhardtii (0.22) [35], or the pennate diatom P. tricornutum (0.43) [36]. These differences reveal that globally the analyzed amino-acid composition of S. robusta genes undergoes a higher level of purifying selection, which is expected if it has a larger effective population size, as suggested by the higher \u03c0S. Furthermore, the distribution of the \u03c0N / \u03c0S ratio was estimated on individual genes (Supplementary Data S4). Interestingly, genes under positive selection are significantly enriched in genes upregulated during early, middle and late sexual reproduction stages, showing that genes involved in sexual reproduction are more prone to undergo diversification in their amino acid sequence, resulting in potential new protein functions. Although some of these genes belong to pleiotropic families (e.g cGMPs and vWDs) and families with reproduction expression bias (e.g. BTB/POZ domain and U box ubiquitin ligases) discussed previously, the vast majority are however genes of unknown function (100/128 genes) and/or species-specific single-copy (63/128), representing interesting candidates for future experimental characterization.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "a4bb8b50-0689-43d0-ba07-aa3028fdcf5b": {"text": "In addition, median \u03c0N / \u03c0S values were further analyzed to compare levels of purifying selection between distinct gene groups. Focusing on different gene age classes, we observed that gene age is positively correlated with purifying selection, with old genes being significantly more constrained than young genes (Supplementary Figure S16A). Genes with homologs in other eukaryotes are also more likely to be functionally annotated than species-specific genes, hence, poorly characterized genes show significantly less purifying selection than genes having functional annotations (Supplementary Figure S16B). Likewise, dispensable genes have significantly higher \u03c0N/\u03c0S values than core genes (Supplementary Figure S16C), suggesting reduced functional constraint for variable genes in the S. robusta species complex. Strikingly, single-copy genes are not displaying significantly more purifying selection than duplicated genes. In contrast, when comparing between gene duplicate types, tandem duplicates are under less constraint than dispersed duplicates (Supplementary Figure S16D) indicating that tandem duplicates are more susceptible to amino acid changes, representing the potential evolution towards novel functionalities. We further observed that genes that are not expressed or show condition-specific expression are less constrained than genes that are broadly expressed (Supplementary Figure S16E-F), the latter which are frequently associated with housekeeping functions. Overall, our findings reveal that different levels of purifying selection act on different subsets of the S. robusta gene repertoire, and that dispensable genes as well as genes showing expression in few conditions are less evolutionary constrained, suggesting they might only be relevant in some specific environments.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "45272503-5fad-4f80-8393-4d95527387cb": {"text": "The Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) database [37] was used as a reference dataset to find S. robusta signature genes that might be implicated in specific morphological or ecological properties.

As many of these signature genes are related to cytoskeleton and membrane composition, this suggests they might play a role in cell wall and/or pennate cell shape formation (, Supplementary Data S7 and Supplementary Note S6). Some examples of these cytoskeleton proteins include an actin-related protein 10 and a microtubule motor kinesin, modulating the dynein-mediated movement that contributes to for instance nuclear migration during mitosis [38]. Another gene with high pennate signature encodes a tubulin-tyrosine ligase/tubulin polyglutamylase, involved in the post-translational modification of tubulins which make up microtubules, as well as a CLASP N-terminal protein, implicated in the attachment of microtubules to the cell cortex and therefore regulating their stability. The loss of function mutation of the latter gene in A. thaliana has shown to result in various plant growth reductions, cell form defects and reduced mitotic activity [39], indicating that CLASP genes can potentially contribute to differences between pennate and centric diatoms in cell division and expansion. We also identified the nucleolar Las1-like protein showing high pennate conservation, which has been linked to cell morphogenesis and cell surface growth in yeast [40] and shows strong upregulation during early sexual reproduction in S. robusta. Related to membrane composition, we identified a CAAX amino terminal protease, inserted in the bilayer structure of the membrane, that is potentially implicated in protein and/or peptide modification and secretion [41]. The upregulation of this protease during early sexual reproduction hints towards a role in recognition during cell pairing between opposite mating types. In contrast, we found a fatty acid desaturase with high pennate signature upregulated during low temperatures, indicating that centric and pennate species might have also evolved different mechanisms to increase membrane fluidity for cold adaptation.

Raphid species are responsive to intracellular calcium, playing a role in changing the speed and direction of locomotion [43]. Calpain proteins are calcium-responsive intracellular proteases that are implicated in the regulation of cell migration by controlling the dynamics of both integrin-mediated adhesion and actin-based membrane protrusion, enabling cell movement by modifying these adhesion sites [44]. To achieve their gliding motility and underwater adhesion, raphid diatoms secrete carbohydrate-rich extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) [27]. In line with this, multiple proteins with strong raphid conservation related to carbohydrate metabolism were also identified, comprising one glycoside hydrolase and seven exostosin-like proteins, the latter encoding glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of sulphated proteoglycans present in the extracellular matrix of mammalian cells [45]. Interestingly, sulphated polysaccharides/proteoglycans have been identified in the EPS and cell wall associated glycoproteins of raphid benthic diatoms such as Stauroneis amphioxys and Craspedostauros australis [46, 47]. The strong conservation of several of these exostosin-like proteins in different raphid benthic species (Supplementary Figure S17) hints towards their importance for EPS synthesis in these diatoms. Additionally, the presence of a raphid-specific ornithine decarboxylase, upregulated during reproduction, further suggests there are unique enzymes in raphid species controlling cell wall synthesis, since the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase, which affects polyamine biosynthesis, has shown to result in a dramatic alteration of diatom silica structure [48]. Furthermore, several raphid-specific membrane transporters were found, as well as proteins containing the \u2018Rab-GTPase-TBC\u2019, \u2018exocyst complex component EXOC3/Sec6\u2019 or \u2018target SNARE coiled-coil\u2019 domain, the latter three encoding key components related to vesicle trafficking [49].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "15e93a4e-0eba-45ef-b82a-28667d35704f": {"text": "Benthic diatoms are frequently part of illuminated surfaces in shallow aquatic systems that are inhabited by dense and highly productive phototrophic biofilms which are characterized by highly variable oxygen and light conditions. To identify genes that can be linked with molecular components explaining the success of diatoms in these environments, we explored the S. robusta gene functions showing strong conservation in other benthic diatoms. Within the set of 492 benthic signature genes, we indeed observed a strong over-representation of different genes that can directly be related to oxygen and light signaling as well as diatom-bacteria interactions (, Supplementary Data S7). Twelve globin-like S. robusta genes with high benthic signature, organized in three different families, were identified. Globins have been found across all phyla of life, meaning that the oxygen transport function of vertebrate hemoglobins is a relatively recent adaptation and that the early globin functions were enzymatic and oxygen-sensing. Dissolved and particulate carbon and nutrient levels are higher within benthic habitats compared to the water column, increasing microbial numbers and heterotrophic activity. As a result, oxygen is quickly depleted, leading to a steep redox gradient in the sediment [50], which implies benthic species may have evolved mechanisms to sense oxygen concentration changes and regulate chemotaxis towards optimal conditions. One of the globin-like signature families is within the top pleiotropic families expanded by tandem duplication ( and Supplementary Figure S18) and is restricted to pennate diatoms (), while the other two families encode for benthic-specific globins (Supplementary Figure 19). Whereas one of these benthic-specific families shows strong upregulation under hydrogen peroxide treatment, future experiments are needed to clarify the role of these globin-like proteins in sensing oxygen concentrations.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "0fcf8742-96ee-4b09-9332-3df147832a06": {"text": "We identified ten putative G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin-like proteins having high benthic signature, of which seven belong to one family expanded by tandem duplication (). In the ocean, the spectral composition of light becomes progressively dominated by blue-green light (400-500 nm) with increasing depth. In biofilms, differential absorption of light by phototrophs and particulate and dissolved matter can contribute to variability in the spectral composition and intensity of available photosynthetically active radiation. Hence, benthic diatoms might have expanded and/or evolved their gene repertoire for light sensing. GPCR rhodopsin-like receptors transduce extracellular signals of a wide range of stimuli including light [51]. The existence of homologs to bacterial proteorhodopsins in some diatoms has been suggested to represent an alternative ATP-generating pathway, especially in iron-limited regions like the Southern Ocean [52]. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the tandem-enriched family containing GPCR rhodopsin-like proteins with high benthic signature is not similar to these proteorhodopsins, rather, their members are more related to rhodopsin-like proteins found in other eukaryotes (Supplementary Figure S20A). Expression analysis of the GPCR rhodopsin-like protein ortholog in P. tricornutum shows this gene is specifically upregulated under blue-green light conditions (Supplementary Figure S20B), confirming our hypothesis this family plays an important role in light sensing.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "f88a9359-ee4a-42c5-a98c-81707e72ff60": {"text": "The enrichment of benthic signature genes upregulated during bacterial interaction experiments (69 genes, Supplementary Figure S21) strongly correlates with a benthic lifestyle, where diatom-bacteria encounters are frequent due to high cell packing in biofilm communities.

Here, we found one of the previously mentioned exostosin-like proteins, as well as a trichome birefringence-like protein, both potentially related to benthic EPS synthesis. In particular, the latter protein is responsible for the O-acetylation of polysaccharides in bacterial biofilm formation, suggesting O-acetylation may also play an important role in benthic diatom biofilm architecture [54]. Benthic signature genes contain several NAD- or NADP-dependent oxidoreductases and detoxification enzymes (Supplementary Figure S21), covering seven short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) and seven glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). While SDRs are enzymes of a great functional diversity, GSTs are often involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and xenobiotics, indicating that benthic diatoms have an evolved gene set to control ROS homeostasis and increase oxidative stress defense in biofilms [55].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "917bc9cf-d17f-4bdc-9a8d-10e79368efe5": {"text": "The reported S. robusta genome sequence and its integration with re-sequencing data from 48 additional strains, large-scale expression profiling, and transcriptome data from different classes of diatoms, provided a unique opportunity to shed light on the genome complexity and evolution in benthic diatoms. To date, S. robusta is the diatom with the largest number of protein-coding genes, of which 40% are of unknown function and 60% are diatom or species-specific. The strong specific expression pattern of many of these genes has provided valuable new insights into the biological processes they are involved in, including 42 families related to sexual reproduction and 71 families showing specific responses to bacterial interactions. Our findings therefore reveal new candidates controlling specific diatom traits. We show that the large number of S. robusta genes that originated through gene family expansions are conserved in the S. robusta species complex and are extending the gene repertoire of this species for molecular sensing, light signaling and motility. Tandem gene duplication is a prominent feature of pleiotropic gene families showing a complex pattern of wide-spread regulation in numerous conditions. Adaptation to the benthos through tandem gene duplication has also been observed in the penaeid shrimp [56], which shares with S. robusta the iGluR expansion. In particular, rhodopsin-like proteins, globins and detoxification enzymes seem to be key players in the ecological adaptation of not only S. robusta, but also of other benthic diatoms that dominate marine biofilms. Whereas the large fraction of dispensable genes in S. robusta indicates a major difference in gene space variation compared to P. tricornutum, the phenotypic, ecological and physiological consequences of missing genes in specific strains remain to be seen.

While yellow is understood to be a by-product of the breakdown of chlorophyll that allows the colour of carotenoids to stand out [Lee 2002, Tanaka et al. 2008], the production of anthocyanins that make the leaves of some species of trees and shrubs red in autumn is controversial. Among current hypotheses [Archetti 2009a], a long-standing [Pringsheim 1879] and prominent one is the photoprotection hypothesis [Field al. 2001, Hoch et al. 2003, Lee et al. 2003]: anthocyanins protect leaves from photooxidative stress. Protection is especially important in autumn, when cold temperatures reduce carbon fixation capacity, light is no longer fully used for photosynthesis due to chlorophyll breakdown, and light is more intense due to a thinning canopy [Ougham et al. 2008]. While protecting senescing leaves themselves is not critical for the plant, photoprotection may allow a better resorption of nutrients. Nitrogen, in particular, is often a limiting factor that strongly influences tree growth [Dickson 1989, Cooke et al. 2005, Schlesinger 2009], and trees have evolved multiple adaptations to reabsorb nitrogen seasonally [Van Cleve and Apel 1993].

MITF controls the expression of tyrosinase (TYR), the main melanogenic enzyme; higher MITF levels will result in more TYR that will generate a higher amount of melanin. Our data suggest that OPN3, via G\u03b1i activation, reduces the amount of cAMP generated by MC1R activation, causing decreased transcription of MITF and, in consequence, of TYR.

Surprisingly, our results disproved this hypothesis: we showed that reducing the mRNA and protein levels of OPN3 in melanocytes () did not alter their Ca2+-mediated responses to physiological levels of UVR, blue, or green light in melanocytes did not alter the response to UVR, blue or green light (). Moreover, when we tested whether purified human OPN3 can respond to visible light, similar to its homologues [24, 25], we found no evidence of visible light absorption in the OPN3 UV-VIS spectrum (), despite weakly binding both 11-cis and all-trans retinal ().", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "8480f3d0-dcef-4d13-a4e6-ac889402cb9e": {"text": "We were puzzled by the finding that human OPN3, despite being able to bind retinal, does not have an absorption peak in the visible range (). This is particularly intriguing considering that OPN3 homologues absorb light in the visible spectrum [24\u201326]. In addition, unlike two recent reports suggesting that human OPN3 functions in a blue light-dependent manner in human skin [41, 42] and in rat and human pulmonary vasorelaxation [41, 42], we did not detect OPN3 sensitivity to blue light by either spectrophotometric analysis or by monitoring Ca2+ levels in melanocytes. One possible scenario is that OPN3 absorbs light outside the range covered by conventional UV-visible spectroscopy (200-700 nm) or that its absorption overlaps with protein absorption (\u03bbmax=280 nm) and is masked by the large protein peak [43]. Alternatively, OPN3 may be light-insensitive and function in a similar manner as retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR), an opsin receptor that binds retinal independent of light stimulus. It was shown that RGR, independent of light, accelerates the conversion of retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinal by modulating isomerohydrolase activity [44]. Thus, it is conceivable that OPN3 is not light-sensitive and retinal binding serves another purpose in OPN3 folding, trafficking, or signaling.

Because melanin production in melanocytes is controlled by the G\u03b1s-coupled MC1R which signals via cAMP, we used genetically encoded cAMP indicators to measure the effect of OPN3 on MC1R-mediated signaling. We found that OPN3 inhibits the MC1R-mediated cAMP response in a G\u03b1i\u2013dependent manner (), indicating that MC1R and OPN3 functionally interact. The functional interaction between OPN3 and MC1R is similar to the mechanism described for the cross-regulation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and steroid hormone adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7), in which PAQR7 regulates skin pigmentation through G\u03b1i-mediated downregulation of GPER activity [45]. The ability of OPN3 to negatively regulate MC1R signaling does not appear to require retinal binding to OPN3, as the OPN3(K299G) mutant is able to modulate MC1R-mediated signaling, despite not binding retinal (), further supporting the idea that OPN3 functions in a light-independent manner in melanocytes.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "6f770408-0b0b-4b1f-8666-10834ab3a337": {"text": "Human OPN3 is likely to be coupled to G\u03b1i, similar to its homologues [24\u201326]. Indeed, using PTX to prevent G\u03b1i activation eliminated the inhibitory effect of OPN3 on MC1R-mediated cAMP signaling (). These results indicate that OPN3 is coupled to G\u03b1i either constitutively or, alternatively, light might turn off OPN3 that is coupled to G\u03b1i. In this case, exposure to light would uncouple OPN3 from G\u03b1i, resulting in an increase in the baseline cAMP. Initially, we were not able to measure light-induced OPN3-dependent changes in cAMP in melanocytes, because the FRET indicator Epac H187, used to monitor cAMP, requires illumination of the cells with visible light in the blue-green range (~ 400\u2013 530 nm). Thus, if the light used for Epac H187 imaging was sufficient to inactivate OPN3, the increase in cAMP could occur prior to starting image acquisition. We circumvented this problem by using a recently developed genetically encoded red cAMP indicator, R-FlincA (\u03bbex = 587 nm) [34]. To determine if blue, green or UV radiation elicits an OPN3-dependent change in baseline cAMP levels, we used MNT-1 cells (with already low endogenous levels of OPN3 ()) to express R-FlincA together with either OPN3-cYFP or YFP. We monitored R-FlincA fluorescence emission before, during, and after stimulation with 200 mW/cm2 of blue, green or UV radiation (Supp. Fig. 6). We did not measure any light-induced or OPN3-dependent changes in cAMP levels, suggesting that the amount of UVR, blue, or green light applied does not modulate OPN3 activity. This would suggest that OPN3 is more likely to have full or partial constitutive activity. The constitutive activity of OPN3 might require conformational changes induced through direct or indirect interaction with MC1R. In fact, MC1R has unusually high partial constitutive activity, which is responsible for the baseline pigmentation in our skin and hair. The constitutive activity of OPN3, coupled to G\u03b1i, could be responsible for regulating both baseline cellular cAMP levels in the absence of MC1R agonists and cAMP levels upon MC1R activation.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "53c61a0a-f0c8-4da0-9264-d902a0f26c1b": {"text": "Our colocalization () and co-immunoprecipitation () data indicate that OPN3 and MC1R reside in the same microdomains where they form a molecular complex.

Alternatively, the microdomain might contain the specific adenylyl cyclase that is activated by MC1R and inhibited by OPN3, or a particular phosphodiesterase that could be modulated by OPN3.

Interestingly, OPN3 was initially identified in deep regions of the brain (hence the initial name \u201cencephalopsin\u201d) [21] including the hypothalamus, where MC3R is also expressed [48\u201350]. This raises the intriguing question of whether OPN3 functions in the brain similar to how it does in melanocytes: could OPN3 interact and negatively regulate the function of other melanocortin receptors like MC3R? OPN3 is not the only opsin that functions as part of a dimeric complex; a functional homomeric complex has also been reported for rhodopsin (OPN2) and cone opsin (OPN1) [40]. These complexes are mediated by residues within the fifth transmembrane domain of human red and green opsins [39], and by transmembrane domain one and helix eight for rhodopsin dimerization [40].

Phosphorous regulates energy storage reactions and maintains structural integrity of cellular membranes (Marschner, 1995). Phosphorous concentration is tightly regulated within the cells because changes in its availability can seriously impair plant physiological processes and structure (Shen ). On one hand, P deficiency affects the overall plant metabolism (Hern\u00e1ndez ) reducing growth (Chiera et al., 2002) and hampering the ability to reproduce and adapt to different environments (Wassen ). On the other hand, P surplus decreases plant performances by inhibiting the biosynthesis of starch (Fredeen ) and other secondary metabolites (e.g. isoprenoids, Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez , Fares ), and lowers nitrate assimilation in the roots (Rufty ).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "6bc26f0b-b7f8-406d-9244-546f4e775008": {"text": "Intensive exploitation of phosphate rock reserves for fertilization purposes may lead to their depletion by the end of this century (Cordell et al., 2009).

In fact, A. donax is able to maintain a high leaf-level photosynthesis and biomass gain under drought (Haworth ) and salinity (Nackley and Kim, 2015). In particular, efficient stomata regulation in A. donax is induced by increase in leaf ABA content in response to drought (Haworth ). Moreover, A. donax is able to adjust the xylem vessel size to regulate the vulnerability to embolism under water deficit conditions (Haworth ).

Tolerance of photosynthesis to high P concentration could be the result of the tight regulation of P homeostasis within the cytoplasm, due to the activation of mechanisms that transport and store the excess of P into the vacuoles (Mimura ). However, excess of P strongly decreased starch accumulation in leaves (Table 4), as confirmed by histological observations (Fig. 4C, D). Our transcriptomics results indicate that the inhibition of starch metabolism in A. donax exposed to +P was mainly due to the transcriptional repression of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, rather than by enhanced translocation of triosophosphates, that reduces the availability of these substrates for starch synthesis in the chloroplasts (Pozueta-Romero ; Heldt ).

In particular, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a substrate for both isoprene biosynthesis and mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial respiration was likely stimulated in plants grown at high P concentration (Fares ). Indeed, we observed an increased transcription of genes involved in energy requiring processes of protein production and export (Fig. S3).

This response to high Na+ concentrations widely occurs across plant species (Delfine ; Centritto ). Stomata closure was likely triggered by increased synthesis of ABA upon salinity stress (Wilkinson and Davies, 2002; Seiler ). In leaves of Na+-stressed A. donax, photosynthesis and ETR were strongly reduced, whereas zeaxanthin and \u03b2-carotene were largely synthesized. This suggests the onset of coordinated photochemical processes to inhibit the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Salinity stress also stimulated the biosynthesis of sucrose in A. donax leaves (Table 4), as also confirmed by the significant over-representation of GO categories related to \u2018carbohydrate metabolic process\u2019 (Table S4). Beside exerting a signaling role (Park ), sucrose was likely able to balance the drop in osmotic potential as leaf RWC decreases during progressive exposure to salinity stress (Table 1). However, changes observed to the leaf ultrastructure of Na+-stressed plants, where only some mesophyll cells and chloroplast resulted completely destroyed (Fig. 5), confirmed that A. donax is moderately sensitive to high Na+ concentration in leaves.

Overall, the simultaneous increases in the biosynthesis of isoprene and carotenoids may imply activation of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in +NaP-stressed A. donax plants to enhance protection against stressful condition (Loreto ; Marino ).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "c808a800-d9d4-46d4-a760-589bdb248350": {"text": "An additive effect of simultaneous supply of high Na+ and P concentrations was clearly highlighted by a 10-fold increase in the number of both up- and down-regulated genes in leaves of +NaP A. donax plants. Some of the most representative transcription factors already identified in A. donax under drought (Fu ) were also regulated under Na+ and P stress. Among them, NAC was strongly induced in +Na, +P and +NaP, whereas WRKY 50, 53 and 41 were down-regulated only in +NaP plants. NAC and WRKY genes family are known to mediate water-(Hadiarto and Tran, 2011) and Na+-stress responses, as well as ABA signaling pathway in plants (Jiang ). Genes coding for stress-associated proteins (SAPs) are important regulators of multiple abiotic stress tolerance (Giri ) and found to be induced in water-stressed A. donax plants (Evangelistella ). However, only two SAPs were down-regulated in +Na and +NaP plants. Despite inducing a higher expression of genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance (e.g., NAC, WRKY and SAP genes), high P concentration exacerbated the reduction of photosynthesis in Na+-stressed A. donax plants, as also indicated by the over-representation of many GO categories related to \u2018cellular metabolic process\u2019 in +NaP plants (Table S4). Photosynthesis could have been limited by altered sugar metabolism, as the amount of non-structural carbohydrates, fructose, glucose and starch increased two-fold in +NaP plants. It is suggested that combined supply of Na+ and P strongly reduced the turnover of carbohydrates, which may have favored the formation of large starch grains in the chloroplasts (Fig. 5D, E, F). Our results show that increase of starch biosynthesis in +NaP plants was related (as in +P plants) to the induction of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, whereas translocation of triosephosphates was not significantly affected. However, in +NaP plants photosynthesis was stimulated under low O2 conditions, indicating that feedback inhibition of photosynthesis, typically induced by carbohydrates accumulation (Sharkey, 1990; Xu ) did not occur. The accumulation of carbohydrates induced by P supply in Na+-stressed plants may serve protective purposes, in enhancing osmotic capacity to assimilate water (Lambers ) as confirmed by the over-representation of GO categories regarding \u2018organic substance metabolic process\u2019 in +NaP plants (Table S4). Carbohydrate accumulation may also help prevent damage to the cell structures (Yang and Guo, 2017). Indeed, the +NaP treatment induced a SNF1-related protein kinase coding gene (SnRK2), which was also found to be responsive to both ionic and non-ionic osmotic stressful conditions (Fu ; Virlouvet and Fromm, 2015). Genes coding for dehydrins (DHNs) proteins, which play cellular protection in abiotic stress tolerance (Gao and Lan, 2016; Verma ), were also up-regulated in leaves of +NaP plants.

Transcriptomics show up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis and down-regulation of \u03b2-carotene (both made by MEP) in +NaP compared to +Na leaves. This suggests a rearrangement of the flux of carbon into the MEP pathway towards hormones controlling stomata movement and away from antioxidants such as isoprene and carotenoids. Moreover, competition with starch for PEP could also limit isoprene synthesis in +NaP as well as in +P leaves (see above). However, starch was not a limiting factor in +NaP leaves as it was in +P leaves. The accumulation of carbohydrates in +NaP leaves was also highlighted by the over-expression of GO categories related to \u2018organic substance metabolic process\u2019 (Table S4), suggesting that a glucose 6-phosphate shunt might have been activated to increase the availability of precursors for the MEP pathway (Sharkey and Weise, 2017), despite the low flux of carbon fixed by photosynthesis.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "5d152a59-b65a-4780-92a6-2a2f9a00bd3d": {"text": "In +NaP leaves, a significant increase of both H2O2 and glutathione (GSH) contents was observed, and further confirmed in our transcriptome analysis by over-representation of GO categories \u2018cellular metabolic process\u2019 and \u2018organic substance metabolic process\u2019 (Table S4), indicating enhanced ROS formation and activation of the anti-oxidant metabolism. Moreover, enhanced biogenesis of peroxisomes in +NaP leaf cells (Fig. 5E, F), most likely indicates a general increase of oxidative stress conditions (Lopez-Huertas ). Peroxisomes contain antioxidants enzymes able to metabolize ROS and to enhance tolerance to a wide range of stresses (Nyathi and Baker, 2006). High synthesis of GSH possibly prevents the increase of H2O2 to reach toxic level while allowing this compound to exert signaling functions (Mittler, 2002; Baxter ) that may further enhance stress response (Knight and Knight, 2001).

Oxyphototrophs often experience fluctuated illumination as light intensity and quality are constantly changing in the natural environment. Under high light or other stress conditions, illumination that exceeds photosynthetic capacity would generate reactive oxygen species, causing photo-oxidative damage to oxyphototrophs (1, 2). Thus, plants have evolved various photoprotective mechanisms, including decreasing light absorption, and dissipating excess absorbed light energy as heat (3, 4). Together, these processes are termed \u201cnon-photochemical quenching\u201d (NPQ). NPQ is classified into four main types, namely the energy-dependent quenching, \u201cqE\u201d; zeaxanthin-dependent quenching, \u201cqZ\u201d; state transitions, \u201cqT\u201d; and photoinhibitory quenching, \u201cqI\u201d (5\u20138), according to their induction and relaxation kinetics and factor-dependency (5, 9). qE is the fastest process to turn on and relax, the formation of which requires a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane (\u0394pH), the photosystem II (PSII) subunit S (PsbS), zeaxanthin and light-harvesting complex (LHC) proteins (10\u201314). qZ and qT depend on a specific carotenoid zeaxanthin (15, 16) and an enzyme pair comprising a chloroplast kinase and phosphatase (17\u201319), respectively. The qI form constitutes a slowly reversible form of NPQ, which is due to the photo-oxidative damage and turnover of the D1 protein of PSII (1).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "72a9ea62-c0ea-4342-be8e-8c267c92b908": {"text": "Recently, a sustained quenching component qH was uncovered (20, 21).

The plastid lipocalin (LCNP), a thylakoid lumen-localized protein, is necessary for qH to occur (20). Lipocalins mainly participate in binding and transporting various hydrophobic molecules (23). Several lipocalins from bacteria and plants participate in membrane biogenesis and repair in response to severe stress conditions by attaching to the membrane lipids (23, 24). A previous report suggests that LCNP mediates the modification of thylakoid membrane lipids, resulting in conformational changes of LHCII and quenching sites formation (20). The working model for qH is that under non-stress conditions, the SUPPRESSOR OF QUENCHING1 (SOQ1) prevents qH through inhibition of LCNP and that under stress conditions, this inhibition is alleviated leading to NPQ (20, 21). The RELAXATION OF QH1 (ROQH1) is an atypical hydrogenase-reductase located on the stromal side which is required for turning off qH (25).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "319fcef8-b10e-45d7-8081-2768f8f1813b": {"text": "SOQ1 is a 108 kDa chloroplast-localized membrane protein that contains three domains: a stromal-located haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (HAD) domain followed by a transmembrane helix (TM), a lumenal-located thioredoxin-like (Trx-like) domain and a \u03b2-propeller NHL domain (21, 22).

A truncated form consisting of the TM and lumenal domains of SOQ1 is sufficient for preventing qH, indicating that the HAD domain is not involved in NPQ suppression (22). The Trx-like domain of SOQ1 belongs to the thioredoxin-like protein (TlpA)-like family (22). Thioredoxins are evolutionarily conserved ubiquitous small thiol oxidoreductases that play key roles in controlling reversible disulfide-bond formation of target proteins to induce their structural and functional switch (26, 27). The Trx-like domain of SOQ1 contains an atypical motif CCINC, similar to the classic WC(G/P)PC redox motif at the active site of thioredoxin proteins (22, 26). It was reported that single mutation of cysteines in the CCINC motif of Trx-like domain (C431S or C434S) disables suppression of NPQ (22), suggesting that SOQ1 prevents NPQ by redox-regulation of downstream target proteins.

Our attempts to obtain the structure of full-length SOQ1 and SOQ1-LD were unsuccessful similarly to what has been reported for NHLRC2 structure (29); we were however able to solve the structure of the CTD. The CTD forms an independent domain in addition to the previously identified three functional domains of SOQ1, and shows high structural similarity with the N-terminal domain of disulfide bond protein D (n-DsbD). We further performed binding assay, cross-linking and molecular dynamics simulation to explore the structure of SOQ1-LD and its regulatory mechanism for qH. In addition, we analyzed lumen protein accumulation in wild type and mutant plants in both stress and non-stress conditions, and found that in vivo cleavage of SOQ1 occurs in both conditions.

Here we further fractionated thylakoid membrane preparation in its membrane and lumen parts from both wild type (Col-0) and soq1-1 mutant grown in standard low light conditions (LL, non-stress situation) or after exposure to a six-hour treatment at 4\u00b0C in high light (cold HL, stress situation) to induce qH. Using a SOQ1 C-terminal peptide antibody, we observed a total of six different bands in wild type sub-chloroplast fractions, which were absent in the soq1-1 mutant and are therefore attributed to SOQ1 (Fig. 6A). The molecular sizes of these six SOQ1 protein forms were assessed as around 114 kDa, 85 kDa, 82 kDa, 65 kDa, 17 kDa and 15 kDa according to the protein marker.

The Trx-like domain and the NHL domain are stably associated, the Trx-NHL interface harbors the key residues for SOQ1 function, and could bind the CTD. Residue E859 is pivotal in maintaining the compact conformation of SOQ1-LD. The E859K mutation changes the surface charge of NHL domain (Fig. 2E), resulting in the loose conformation of the Trx-NHL interface and hence the highly flexible CTD, thus destabilizing the three lumenal domains of SOQ1, which may lead to the loss of the suppression function of the soq1-2 mutant reported previously (22).", "figure_ref": ["fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "37111f6c-2da8-4b48-8932-d7b277ad9db6": {"text": "In addition, our work provides new information about the CTD of SOQ1, showing that the CTD and Trx-like domain of SOQ1 adopt similar folding with n-DsbD and c-DsbD, respectively. The working mechanism of DsbD was recently proposed (36\u201338). The oxidized c-DsbD accepts electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin through the central transmembrane domain (t-DsbD), and further reduces n-DsbD through inter-domain disulfide exchange (36, 37). Afterwards, the reduced n-DsbD moves away to interact with its substrate proteins and provides the reducing equivalents (36, 37). In n-DsbD, the Cap-loop containing a conserved Phe residue is positioned adjacent to the Cys pair, shielding the thiol groups of reduced n-DsbD and facilitating the dissociation of n-DsbD from c-DsbD which prevents a futile redox cycle (36, 37). SOQ1 may function similarly as DsbD with its CTD participating in redox-transduction from the Trx-like domain to target protein(s) (Fig. 7). Our MST results showed that Trx-like domain and CTD interact in solution, which further proves the possibility of the redox coupling between Trx-like domain and CTD. We propose that the NHL domain, which shares no homology with t-DsbD and does not contain conserved Cys residues, may serve as a scaffold supporting the redox coupling between the Trx-like domain and CTD. In chloroplast, the homolog of t-DsbD is CCDA (plant homolog of the bacterial control of cell death protein), a thylakoid membrane-anchored protein which functions as a thiol disulfide transporter (22, 39). SOQ1 Trx-like domain, when not cleaved, is right after the transmembrane helix and would be localized close to the thylakoid membrane and may, therefore, accept reducing power from the stromal side through CCDA, and transfer electrons to lumenal side substrates through the CTD. The long \u03b2B-C loop containing F950 is close to the C1006-C1012 pair in CTD (Fig. 5A), and may function as a Cap-loop as that in n-DsbD. Moreover, CTD shows higher mobility compared with other domains of SOQ1 as shown by our structures and crosslinking results (Table S2), which may facilitate the interaction of CTD with its substrate proteins. Based on the structural and sequence similarity between SOQ1 and NHLRC2, we can extrapolate that the C-terminal extension in NHLRC2, with a conserved Cys pair, may also function as n-DsbD. Next it will be of interest to test whether redox imbalance in NHLRC2 potential substrates may cause FINCA disease. Conversely, knowledge on SOQ1 and NHLRC2 could inform research on finding antibiotics against DsbD as a target in human pathogens such as from the Neisseria species (36).", "figure_ref": ["fig7", "fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "2b322122-1286-432e-901e-f0267a56402e": {"text": "SOQ1 may accept reducing power from stromal redox proteins, such as thioredoxins, through membrane-located CCDA, which changes the redox state of lumenal Trx-like domain of SOQ1, resulting in the reduced C431 and C434 pair.

The \u03b2B-C loop in CTD might function similarly as the cap loop in nDsbD, shielding the reduced C1006 and C1012 and inducing the dissociation of CTD from the Trx-like domain.

LCNP shows an altered electrophoretic mobility in the soq1-1 mutant, suggesting that it might have some modifications (20). LCNP contains 12 methionines and 6 cysteines, and is located in the thylakoid lumen which is an oxidizing environment (39), thus LCNP may be activated through oxidized modifications, such as cysteine or methionine oxidation (40). SOQ1 may suppress qH by reducing the oxidized modification of LCNP directly or through other proteins which would be redox-regulated by SOQ1. Interestingly, DsbD was suggested to transfer electrons to several oxidoreductases including DsbG and PilB, to produce unmodified thiol group from sulfenylated proteins, or repair oxidized methionine residues (35). Another possibility is that SOQ1 could be involved in reduction of disulfide bonds for proper protein folding, similarly to DsbD providing electrons to protein disulfide isomerase DsbC (41).

We predict the lumenal forms to be the soluble domains Trx-NHL-CTD, NHL-CTD (containing a few amino acids before the N-terminal of the NHL domain), CTD, and the 85kDa form in the membrane fractions to be SOQ1 lacking the HAD domain (Fig. 6). However, we did not observe significant differences in the accumulation of these truncated forms between non-stress and stress conditions, in which SOQ1 is hypothesized to be active and inactive, respectively (21). Whether this cleavage has a role in regulating SOQ1 function and is spontaneous or assisted by protease will require further investigation. It could be that the soluble forms of SOQ1 alter the efficiency of electron transfer from the putative membrane electron donor CCDA to the electron acceptors in the lumen. Indeed our work evidences post-translational processing in the lumen but without degradation of the sub-products which may thus have a functional role. Recently, the human SOQ1 ortholog NHLRC2 was also reported to be cleaved into a 58 kDa form (equivalent to Trx-NHL, full-length of NHLRC2 is 79 kDa) by caspase 8 in ROS-induced apoptosis (42), with a cleavage site at Asp580 before the C-terminal domain of NHLRC2 (corresponding residue is Gln903 in the NC-loop of SOQ1). It was proposed that NHLRC2 itself may participate in caspase activation by regulating the redox state of the catalytic cysteine thiol group of caspase (42).

Translated into units we can oversee, the absorption of a single green 500-nm photon by a 35-kDa protein compares to the traceless swallowing of a 4 g, 9 mm Parabellum bullet, fired from a shotgun at the speed of sound, by a 35-g slab of soft biological matter. This apocalyptic event, taking place in myriads at every twinkle of the eye, forms the basis of oxygenic photosynthesis for the benefit of every form of Life on the Planet. Whereas the photosystems and their elaborate light-harvesting antennae undertake every effort not to waste incident photons, the sheer chemistry of light-induced reactions at the same time required the development of protective mechanisms against photodamage by reactive oxygen species and other radicals. Cyanobacteria developed a tightly controlled system of photoprotection to shield their photosynthetic reaction centers from the harmful effects of intense solar radiation, in which the 35 kDa Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) plays the central role. As if to carry things to extremes, it is the 567 Da carotenoid cofactor 3\u2019-hydroxyechinenone (hECN) performing the task of photon absorption to bring about OCP photoconversion from the basal orange state OCPO to the red active state OCPR, the latter being able to tightly interact with the soluble phycobilisome (PBs) antennae complexes to quench their fluorescence and prevent the flow of excessively absorbed excitation energy to the photosystems [1-8].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "a8ded96c-a9df-43ae-9186-2bfbaa76c5a8": {"text": "The structural organization of OCP is modular, with an N-terminal and C-terminal domain (NTD and CTD, respectively) of about equal size, which symmetrically encapsulate one carotenoid molecule within a central cavity [9-11]. Whereas OCP can accommodate a variety of xanthophylls, photo- and PBs quenching activity is only possible with 4-(4\u2019-)ketolated carotenoid derivatives. The importance for the keto moiety is underlined by the fact that the only specific protein-carotenoid interactions exist in the basal OCPO form, comprising two hydrogen bonds from Trp-288 and Tyr-201 in the CTD to the 4-keto oxygen at the terminal \u03b2-ring [12-15]. In OCPO, the compact structure is further stabilized by protein-protein interactions across the large inter-domain interface including the Arg-155/Glu-244 salt bridge and a contact formed between the short \u03b1A-helix in the 20 amino acid-long N-terminal extension of the NTD with a specific part of the outer surface of the CTD [16, 17]. Upon photon absorption and isomerization of the carotenoid, the specific protein-chromophore H-bonds break, the \u03b1A-helix detaches and unfolds from the CTD and both domains separate with the carotenoid sliding by about 12 \u00c5 completely into the NTD [18-20].", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "f3ac54b1-b454-4da5-af52-77cb0004ae61": {"text": "Already the first attempts to purify OCP from native sources revealed a contamination by a red 16 kDa fragment, which was termed Red Carotenoid Protein (RCP) and was later identified as the OCP-NTD coordinating the carotenoid, which might be formed from full-length OCP in vivo (and forms in vitro) by proteolysis [11, 21, 22]. Deciphering of more and more cyanobacterial genomes revealed that OCP is broadly distributed, but, astonishingly, a large fraction of cyanobacterial genomes harbor genes for one or multiple isolated genes for NTD as well as CTD homologs on top of the OCP gene [23, 24]. Some cyanobacteria even harbor only genes for NTD and CTD homologs. Whereas the functional role(s) of the NTD homologs, which have been termed helical carotenoid proteins or HCPs for their exclusively \u03b1-helical secondary structure elements, has well been established as being the effector modules of the photoprotective mechanism, the role and importance of the multiple and wide-spread CTD homologs, though being structurally related to the widespread superfamily of mixed \u03b1/\u03b2-structured nuclear transport factor-2-like (NTF-2, PFAM 02136) protein domains, was only vaguely defined as \u201caccessory\u201d or \u201cmodulatory\u201d since CTD fragments purified from cyanobacteria never contained carotenoids. Only recently, using carotenoid-producing E. coli strains for protein production, it was shown that the OCP-CTD (termed COCP for C-terminal OCP-related carotenoid-binding protein) indeed forms a carotenoid-binding entity by employing a symmetric, highly stable dimeric arrangement, in which two COCP monomers coordinate a single, symmetrically oxygenated xanthophyll such as canthaxanthin (CAN) or zeaxanthin (ZEA) [25]. This highly symmetric configuration entailed the by far most red-shifted absorption spectrum from all OCP derivatives characterized so far, very low chirality in the visual CD spectra and distinct, unprecedented features at the characteristic v1 to v4 bands in Raman spectra [25]. Moreover, upon mixing of COCP(CAN) with the apoprotein form of the NTD (Apo-RCP), spectral and functional features of an OCPO-like state appeared, which readily underwent photoconversion resulting in the formation of RCP that was capable of PBs fluorescence quenching [25]. In effect, these findings revealed an as yet unprecedented carotenoid transfer mechanism initiated by COCP suggesting that isolated COCP homologs in cyanobacteria may play some role in carotenoid mobilization and storage, besides acting as singlet oxygen quenchers [23, 25, 26]. The modular architecture of OCP and the possibility to assemble it in fully functional form from its separated domains allows tailoring the use of carotenoid-binding entities according to highly specialized functions needed by the cell.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "ccd1fc60-76e1-43fc-8abe-83defddf8b8b": {"text": "The processes leading to chromophore integration during maturation of OCP are not known yet.

Here, we study this process in detail to elucidate the reaction steps leading to assembly of functional OCP by spectroscopy and bioanalytical techniques. Carotenoid transfer starts from the violet COCP with an interaction of the N-terminal extension (NTE) of the OCP apoprotein with COCP followed by dissociation of dimeric COCP as a rate-limiting step, thus uncapping the carotenoid for insertion into the NTD of the OCP apoprotein and resulting in a red intermediate that spontaneously underwent conversion to the OCPO state. During the transfer, several reaction intermediates are identified that rely on the intimate interactions existing between isolated CTDs or NTD-CTD, respectively, some of which including mixed OCP dimers connected via a single carotenoid molecule, and these assemblies are characterized in detail by analytical size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "048abf13-b853-4832-af8c-01c15f16287a": {"text": "Cloning, expression and purification of the His6-tagged Synechocystis OCPWT apoprotein, its apoprotein form lacking the N-terminal extension (NTE) comprising the first 20 amino acids (\u0394NTE), and FRP were described previously [13, 14, 16, 27].

In order to model the structure of the Apo-OCP dimer, the CTD-CTD dimeric core (residues 185-317 from the 4XB5 structure) was fixed according to the proposed symmetric COCP structure [25], whereas the NTDs (residues 3-161 from the 4XB5 structure) were allowed to move freely and independently, while being connected to CTDs by natural flexible linkers (residues 162-184). The N-terminal hexahistidine tag and its connection to the NTD (17 residues overall) were also considered flexible in both chains. Such a structure (P1 overall symmetry) was modeled using CORAL [35] by minimization of the discrepancy between the model and the experimental SAXS curve calculated by Crysol.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "742fff07-2d02-48c3-8f62-d7f305f2d1a6": {"text": "As shown in our recent study, when expressed in carotenoid-producing strains of E. coli, the CTDs of OCP can effectively form rather stable protein dimers symmetrically linked by a single carotenoid molecule (COCP), and mixing COCP with Apo-RCP produced a transient OCPO-like species [25].

The resulting spectrum can be decomposed into the sum of spectra from an orange (OCPO) and violet (COCP) forms (dashed and dotted lines in Figure 1A, respectively), indicating that, under the conditions used, 73% of the carotenoid is transferred from COCP into OCP, while 27% remain in some form that is spectrally indistinguishable from COCP.

However, under all conditions tested, even at high Apo-OCP to COCP concentration ratios, the remaining spectral contribution from the violet COCP-like forms never vanished completely. This observation is striking, especially since the carotenoid transfer occurred spontaneously, which should result in vanishing of the initial violet COCP species assuming that the backward transfer of the carotenoid from OCP to Apo-COCP does not occur, as determined in independent experiments [25].

Interestingly, for such a process to take place, the COCP dimers obviously must dissociate in order to pass the carotenoid to its acceptor, Apo-OCP, and this should lead to a limited initial rate of the spectral change, if dimer dissociation precedes the transfer process. The spectrally orange form obtained as the result of the transfer is stable, and its photoconversion is fully reversible (Figure 1B), allowing for an accurate estimation of the photoconversion (O-R) and consequent back-relaxation (R-O) rates (see Figure 1B, and E).

In contrast, changes in O.D. upon the carotenoid transfer from the COCP-W288A mutant (carrying an alanine substitution of the critical Trp-288 [Synechocystis OCPWT numbering], which forms an H-bond to the keto-group at the \u03b2-ring of the carotenoid) into Apo-OCP were perfectly monoexponential and occurred significantly faster, with no apparent lag-phase. These observations can be readily explained by a higher stability of the wildtype COCP homodimers compared to those of the COCP-W288A mutant, in which the important H-bond between the keto-group of CAN and tryptophan is disrupted [14], which should contribute to destabilization of the dimeric structure of COCP-W288A. Indeed, the difference in the activation energies of the V-O transition for COCP and its W288A mutant is approximately 13 kcal/mol (Figure 1E, Table 1), which we tentatively assign to the difference of two N-H\u22efO=C type H-bonds between the keto-group of the carotenoid and the imino nitrogen of the Trp-288 side chain, and this roughly corresponds to other reported values (1 H-bond ~ 5 kcal/mol [36]). Thus, destabilization of the COCP\u2013carotenoid complex owing to removal of the H-bond donors could be correlated with the faster rate of the carotenoid transfer and the absence of the lag-phase at the beginning of the V-O transition (Figure 1D). In turn, this indicates that dissociation of the otherwise very stable COCP dimer may be (i) the reason for the higher energy barrier and (ii) the cause for the initial delay (lag-phase) observed during carotenoid transfer from the wildtype COCP into Apo-OCP. Analogous s-shaped kinetics of OCP-related transitions were also observed during the fluorescence recovery after OCP-induced quenching of phycobilisomes in vivo, during which monomerization of FRP occurs and causes an increase in fluorescence recovery rate [14, 37].

The NTE is important for stabilization of CTD and NTD interactions [9, 16, 38], and one can suppose that its absence would eliminate steric hindrances in the course of the carotenoid transfer from COCP to OCP.

Even at the highest protein concentration loaded on the column, the SEC profile revealed a mixture of dimers and monomers of the protein, whereas at low protein concentrations, the monomers were prevailing even despite the presence of carotenoid (Figure 2A).

The concentration-dependent behavior of COCP-W288A is similar to that of Apo-COCP (Figure 2A) and supports the idea that the fast kinetics of carotenoid transfer to Apo-OCP (Figure 1D) correlates well with the facilitated dissociation of COCP mutant dimers, and that the W288A mutation entails crucial destabilization of protein-chromophore interactions within the CTD of OCP.", "figure_ref": ["fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}, "ce77f679-39c3-4665-8f86-d3283bbe93ea": {"text": "(A) \u2013 SEC profiles of COCP-W288A (inset) obtained at different protein concentrations loaded on a column and followed by carotenoid-specific absorbance.

Of note, this is somewhat contradictory to the earlier interpretation by Blankenship and co-workers that OCP photoactivation is accompanied by dissociation of stable OCPO dimers [39], and to the crystal structures, in which OCPO consistently forms a compact dimer [9, 19, 40] suggesting that the real situation of the oligomeric status of OCP is more complex. Our earlier SEC studies revealed that OCPO forms monomers with lesser tendency of self-association than the purple OCP-W288A mutant or Apo-OCP [13, 25, 27]. Questioning whether concentration-dependent dimerization is inherent to any OCP form with separated domains, we analyzed different concentrations of either OCPR or Apo-OCP by SEC (Figure 2C and D).

This experiment showed that, even though most likely not the whole population of OCP was converted to OCPR, the peak gradually shifted toward earlier elution times, again indicating concentration-dependent protein self-association. This further supports our earlier conclusions that the OCP-W288A mutant mimics properties of photoactivated OCPR [14].

Since the NTD has higher affinity to the carotenoid molecule than the CTD, it accepts the carotenoid from one of the CTD subunits of the anchored COCP. This leads to closure of OCP with bound carotenoid into the compact OCPO-like structure (stage 3) stabilized by carotenoid (stage 4). Efficiency of carotenoid transfer is high, and over 70% of carotenoid from COCP is transmitted to the orange photoactive form. However, as Apo-OCP tends to form homodimers at high concentrations, such structures could be stabilized by cross-domain carotenoid binding (confirmed by the data on Figure 4). Alternative pathway (right part) requires preliminary monomerization of COCP (effectively achieved by COCP-W288A mutant) or involvement of some other carotenoid carrier.", "figure_ref": ["fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "c46b1df4-dd26-4127-8495-9c7d6e59d5f8": {"text": "The absorption spectrum of the GFP-OCPApo chimera in the visible region is related exclusively to the absorption of GFP (Figure 5A) with a maximum at 488 nm. Subsequent mixing of COCP and GFP-OCPApo results in significant changes of absorption accompanying the formation of the orange state, equivalent to such transitions described for Apo-OCP (see Figure 1). After introduction of the carotenoid into GFP-OCPApo and formation of the photoactive orange state, we observed an appreciable decrease in GFP fluorescence lifetime. The major component (62%) of the fluorescence decay was characterized by a lifetime of 1.62 ns, while in the initial GFP-OCPApo the decay was monoexponential with a lifetime of 3.05 ns (Figure 5B). EET efficiency was estimated to be equal to 42.5 %. We calculated the overlap integrals and corresponding F\u00f6rster radii \u2013 56.9 \u00c5 and 59.6 \u00c5 for OCPO and COCP, respectively. The observed EET efficiency corresponds to a distance between the donor and acceptor of about 61 \u00c5, which is approximately the size of the OCP molecule. This observation indicates that the orientation factor \u043a2 could be low (transition dipoles are close to perpendicular), since the real distance between the carotenoid and the GFP chromophore is definitely less than 60 \u00c5. Unfortunately, no significant difference between the lifetimes of GFP-OCP in its orange and red state was found experimentally, which is probably due to small changes of the donor-acceptor distance or the unfavorable orientation factor. However, we can conclude that GFP fluorescence is sensitive to the presence of carotenoid in close proximity, thus, the fluorescence of GFP allowed us to study carotenoid transfer, as its products are characterized by EET to the carotenoid cofactor, which is absent in GFP-OCPApo.", "figure_ref": ["fig5", "fig1", "fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "793c641b-3052-47e4-bcbe-f3dfd1be9fcb": {"text": "We studied the kinetics of either absorbance or GFP fluorescence changes during carotenoid transfer upon mixing of GFP-OCPApo and COCP, and the most striking differences were found in the shape of the respective time-courses, especially their initial parts (Figure 5C). Changes of GFP fluorescence occurred without any lag phase and could be perfectly approximated by the sum of two exponential decay exponents. The fast component of GFP fluorescence quenching upon the transfer is significantly faster than the changes of 550 nm absorption measured under exactly the same experimental conditions. Thus, GFP seems to be sensitive to the formation of an intermediary complex with a violet carotenoid in the CTD-CTD arrangement, even before the carotenoid gets into its final position between the CTD and NTD. Analysis of the temperature dependencies of the rates of absorption changes and of the rates of fluorescence decay components revealed that the slow component of GFP fluorescence decay and the changes in absorption have the same \u0394H and \u0394S values (Table 1), strongly suggesting that they are related to the same processes. The slow component of fluorescence changes is probably associated with the adjustments of protein structure that are following relocation of the carotenoid and are necessary for stabilization of the orange form. Thus, carotenoid transfer is initiated by formation of an intermediate complex with a carotenoid carrier, violet COCP, where changes of carotenoid absorption did not occur yet. We may refer to this phase of carotenoid transfer as the \u201canchoring stage\u201d.", "figure_ref": ["fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "2a79f7f0-0c67-4706-982c-a8f18094ae1d": {"text": "We want to summarize the results of our study by proposing a working model of the carotenoid transfer mechanism between COCP and Apo-OCP (Figure 5), which might occur during chromophore insertion and assembly of photoactive and photoprotective OCP in vivo. It is safe to assume that incorporation of the carotenoid should not occur co-translationally, but requires synthesis and folding of the OCP apoprotein. However, carotenoids are synthesized, processed and stored at or in membranes, while Apo-OCP is a water-soluble protein, thus the mechanism of carotenoid transfer through the aqueous cytoplasm is not clear. One could assume that an Apo-OCP, with its open domain structure, could drag a carotenoid out of the membrane by itself, however, the presence of water-soluble carotenoid carriers such as COCPs could significantly facilitate the assembly of holo-OCP and play important role in regulation of the cellular holo-OCP content for photoprotection in cyanobacteria. Of note, many cyanobacterial species harbor one or several separate genes for CTD and NTD (HCP) analogs [23, 24]. Whereas the physiological role of NTD (HCP) analogs is well established, the as yet orphan CTD homologs could be assigned a physiological role at least during maturation and regulation of fully functional OCPs cycling.", "figure_ref": ["fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "1ce4a1c7-a99f-4819-95c4-72b77042e946": {"text": "In this work, we show how the simple addition of OCP apoprotein readily leads to the breaking up of the otherwise very stable COCP dimer, eventually extracting the carotenoid from this assembly, which involves carotenoid translocation from one hydrophobic protein environment into another thus obviating a passage through the solvent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a protein-to-protein carotenoid transfer. In this unprecedented OCP case, the process predominantly results in the formation of the orange OCP form, which undoubtedly represents OCPO in the monomeric state (see Figures 1 and 2). However, our results also suggest that formation of OCPO upon carotenoid transfer passes through several different and spectroscopically distinguishable intermediate states. First of all, the NTE, which is responsible for stabilization of CTD-NTD interactions in the orange form, may bind COCP (Figure 5, Stage 1), which, being a dimer of two OCP-CTDs, has two sites for interactions with the NTE. Binding of COCP via NTE increases the probability that Apo-OCP can approach the carotenoid-containing CTD, when spontaneous monomerization of COCP due to protein dynamics [25] may occur (Figure 5, Stage 2). The existence of such a violet intermediate was demonstrated by fusion of GFP to the N-terminus of OCP (see Figure 4), which appeared to be sensitive to the presence of carotenoid. We may hypothesize that the interaction with the NTE may also affect the stability of COCP and initiate its monomerization, which requires disruption of a critical hydrogen bond between the keto-oxygen of carotenoid and Trp-288 in one of CTDs. Subsequently, the carotenoid enters the NTD of Apo-OCP, a process, which is determined by its higher affinity to NTD that is supported by the fact that carotenoid transfer from the NTD into Apo-CTD could not be observed. After this crucial transfer step, stabilization of the orange state occurs as a regular and well-described relaxation of the red form. At this stage (3) the most significant changes of carotenoid absorption could be monitored. We assume that the rate of carotenoid transfer depends on the characteristic rate of R-O relaxation (as a limiting step) and the concentration of COCP monomers (or Apo-OCP\u2013COCP complexes).", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig2", "fig5", "fig5", "fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "3e5845ab-6936-4476-a04a-1b3de7f1f6c2": {"text": "In fact, the absence of the NTE dramatically reduces carotenoid transfer efficiency (see Figure 1D), though not abolishing it completely, which indicates that the NTE-CTD interaction may be involved in COCP recruiting or anchoring by Apo-OCP. Alternative ways for transfer require the carotenoid carrier to be in the monomeric state (which is a minor state for COCP, but a major state for its W288A mutant, see Figure 2). Of note, several reaction intermediates could be obtained as side products of the proper carotenoid transfer process due to the ability of two CTDs to form a homodimer, and NTD and CTD to form heterodimer, which are stabilized by carotenoid. This way is not effective if the initial carotenoid carrier is as stable as COCP, however, destabilization of COCP (e.g., by W288A mutation) leads to a significant increase of the transfer rate. The question of carotenoid content in the CTD carrier is also important, as in vivo OCP binds echinenone (ECN) or 3\u2019-hydroxy-ECN, thus stabilization of CTDs protein-protein interactions by such mono-ketolated carotenoids by two H-bonds is impossible, thus leaving unketolated (hydroxylated) carotenoid \u03b2-ring exposed for possible interactions with the NTD of Apo-OCP. Thus, our in vitro experiments revealed several hidden features of OCP assembly and highlights a particular role of the NTE, which not only stabilizes CTD and NTD interactions in holo-OCP, but also plays important role in the initial stage of Apo-OCP-COCP interaction to greatly facilitate the reconstruction of the photoactive OCP from its apoprotein form. In the cell, COCP and probably its individual homologs could serve as carotenoid depot that readily supply their cargo to full-length OCP when the cell turns on OCP synthesis for photoprotection.", "figure_ref": ["fig1", "fig2"], "table_ref": []}}, "10.1101/851535": {"1f076962-a6c2-4bde-b380-f8fa11c5447a": {"text": "Tardigrades (water bears) are microscopic (0.5 to 1 mm) limno-terrestrial animals with four pairs of legs.

It lacks the genes that promote stress-induced damage and there is a selective expansion of gene families responsible for decreasing various stress-induced damages.

It results in cyclobutane\u2013pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6\u20134 photoproducts (pyrimidine adducts) in genomic DNA, which affects replication and transcription. They can also cause lethal mutagenic effects (Sinha and Hader, 2002). UV radiation also damages DNA indirectly by producing reactive oxygen species. There are several organisms that resist lethal effects of UV radiation using multiple mechanisms. Deinococcus radiodurans has developed an efficient DNA repair pathway, which is responsible for its resistance to high ionizing radiation as well as UV radiation (Krisko and Radman, 2013). Production of pigments/compounds that absorb UV radiation is another mechanism commonly found in organisms from bacteria to mammals (Singh and Gabani, 2011). Cyanobacteria and other microbes produce UV-absorbing compounds such as scytonemin, myosporine and related amino acids (Oren and Gunde-Cimerman, 2007; Rastogi and Incharoensakdi, 2014). Halobacterium salinarium, a red pigmented bacterium, produces bacterioruberin which protects it from UV radiation (Dummer et al., 2011).

It is achieved by the development of several strategies to maximize the efficiency of this process (Janik et. al., 2015). Under low light conditions, plants need to harvest most available photons to sustain photosynthesis, while under high light they must dissipate the excess energy absorbed in order to avoid photodamage (Ruban 2016). Thus, in ecosystems where light is the most dynamic and limiting resource, its availability determines the establishment, growth, and survival of plant species (Valladares et. al., 2002). For example, in evergreen forests light availability is highly variable due to a number of factors such the rotation of the earth, wind-induced movement of leaves, leaf deployment, canopy architecture, and dynamics of gaps formation (Whitmore 1989; Valladares et. al., 1997). Also, plants, and particularly trees, are progressively exposed to higher irradiances as they grow taller (Kira and Yoda 1989; Coopman et al. 2011). Consequently, several tree species can, to some degree, change their light requirements through a suite of anatomical, morphological, and physiological leaf traits that allow them to adjust the photosynthetic apparatus to suit a new light environment (Coopman et al. 2008; Lusk et al. 2008; Poorter et al. 2010; Coopman et al. 2011).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "068cd731-dbad-4da9-91ef-6488a34c3da2": {"text": "Plant adaptation to a specific light environment can be viewed in terms of benefits (e.g., photosynthetic carbon gain) and cost (e.g., maintaining morphological and physiological flexibility) of various traits. Adaptation is expected to result in a situation where the ratio of benefits to cost is maximized (Bj\u00f6rkman 1981). In shade environments, there is little return on investment in increasing the capacity of photosynthetic reactions, and resources are better invested in light harvesting. The reverse is true in high light environments, where electron transport, carboxylation capacity, and stomatal conductance tend to be maximized. After Givnish (1988) presented a comprehensive view of plant adaptations to sun and shade, a vast number of studies have described several morpho-anatomical and biochemical traits with adaptive value to optimizing the use of light. For example, the light harvesting complexes (LHCs) respond to the amount of light by having a dual functionality based on the different configurations of the pigment-protein system of the complex, resulting in a switch from light-harvesting to a photoprotective state (Liguori et. al., 2015).

Thus, inside the canopy a mosaic of light environments exists that strongly affects plant growth and fitness.

Key aspects of the synchronicity of growth responses to light environment are: (i) the integration of multiple external and internal cues; (ii) the uses of shared regulatory elements such as transcription factors, target proteins, hormones and secondary metabolites in diverse developmental cascades; and (iii) the role of physiological feedback to provide environmental information to the new forming photosynthetic tissues (Sultan 2010). This ultimately constitutes a critical aspect of the ecological breadth for forest species. For these reasons, plants have developed life strategies from which it is possible to recognize two major groups, shade-tolerant species and light-demanding species.

This early successional and short-lived temperate rainforest tree species is endemic to Chile and Argentina. Although this species mostly regenerates in shaded understories (Donoso 1978), seedlings and saplings can be found growing under a wide range of light conditions, from less than 5% of canopy openness to ca. 50% (Lusk 2002 and references therein) as well as in forest edges (personal observation, Fig. 1). Its leaves are highly plastic (Donoso 2006). Among the ca. 13 coexisting tree species in this forest-type (Lusk et al. 2008), G. avellana is the only known species that shows strong heteroblasty. Its leaves change drastically from simple to highly compound leaves during early development (Ostria-Gallardo et. al., 2015). In addition, when growing under high light conditions, this species produces larger and more complex leaves (Fig. 1). We previously demonstrated that the heteroblastic trajectory of leaf size and complexity depends on the prevailing light availability of the specific micro-environment where individual plants are established and grow (Ostria-Gallardo et al., 2015, 2016). This involves the coordination of light-mediated signals, hormone synthesis and signaling, and the heterochrony of the ontogenetic program. The responses of functional traits, such as leaf longevity and leaf mass per area, to light availability and the ontogenetic variation in light requirements have been reported for this species (Lusk et al., 2008; 2011). However, the genetic basis that regulates the physiological acclimation allowing G. avellana to grow in a wide variety of light environments remains unknown. Our hypothesis is that the ability of G. avellana to grow under a wide range of light conditions relies on the flexibility in the gene network to respond appropriately and comprehensively to signals from the prevailing light environment. We used two experimental approaches to identify gene co-expression networks that underpin the photosynthetic and metabolic performance allowing this tree to develop under different light environments. We used the transcriptome dataset of leaf primordia from G. avellana previously published by Ostria-Gallardo and coworkers (2016) to conduct a gene co-expression network analysis with genes involved in photosynthesis and light-related processes.

According to reports of Lusk and coworkers (2006, 2008) detailing the ecological effects of light availability on the light requirement of temperate rainforest tree species, those species that possess a longer leaf life span and that tend to accumulate multiple foliage cohorts are more stable to variations in light availability. G. avellana, particularly, does not have significant changes in minimum light requirement along its ontogeny (plants of 10 to 120 cm height; Lusk et al., 2008). This means that while growing, this tree may tolerate low light conditions without facing carbon starvation, as is seen to occur in shade intolerant species (Escand\u00f3n et al. 2013). According to our results, the maximum quantum yield of low and high light acclimated plants reflects healthy photosynthetic apparatus capable of using most of the light energy to conduct effective photochemistry. Surprisingly, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which is a molecular response of photosynthetic membranes in which the excess of light is dissipated as heat (Ruban, 2016), showed similar values between low and high light acclimated plants. Since along the forest canopy in which G. avellana grows, different scenarios of high irradiance occur (i.e. high frequency of sunflecks, gaps or high light intensity in open space), this protective mechanism against photodamage is used by G. avellana in a balanced way, no matter the light condition, so that the use of light available for photosynthesis is not affected. We observed that below a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 500 \u00b5mol m\u22122s\u22121, the maximum photosynthesis rate as well as the evapotranspiration rate of G. avellana was similar in low and high light acclimated plants; however, at higher PPFD the photosynthetic (Amax and WUEi) and photochemical (\u03a6PSII, ETR and qP) responses were significantly higher in high light acclimated plants, suggesting that G. avellana is able to grow under high light intensities without losing its intrinsic capacity to grow under low light.

SOM clustering has been used in many large-scale transcriptome data set analyses to detect groups of genes with similar expression profiles that yields biological relevant results (Chitwood et al., 2013, Ranjan et al., 2015, Ichihashi et al., 2014; Ostria-Gallardo et al., 2016). Because the use of block-wise module detection may influence the results and performance when there is a large number of blocks (van Dam et al., 2017), the use of SOM can help to obtain a reliable selection of a subset of genes in the transcriptome in order to construct a weighted gene co-expression network involved in light energy use for photosynthesis and related processes. The combination of WGCNA and the IGRAPH packages for network construction using this subset of genes produced a robust community structure whose properties and memberships were effective in identifying co-expression patterns with an appropriate biological relevance for the photochemical responses of G. avellana. In general, the use of gene co-expression networks has provided consistent relationships between transcriptional profiles and phenotypic traits (Zinkgraf et al., 2017; Suzuki et al., 2017). Our results revealed a dynamic molecular regulation of the photosynthetic machinery and carbon assimilation pathways as well as of the photoprotective and antioxidant system which is tightly coordinated with the prevailing light environment where this tree grows. Thus, differentially expressed genes included in module 1 belonged mostly to plants inhabiting low light environments and reflects co-expression of genes involved mainly in chlorophyll biosynthesis and regulation of the antenna complex size, reaction centers of photosystems, and oxygen evolving complex. By the other hand, genes included in modules four and fifteen belonged mostly to high light plants and were involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, respiration, cell wall formation, and photoprotection. Our in-silico construction of the light-driven gene co-expression network in G. avellana, when combined with an ecophysiological approach provides a comprehensive basis for understanding the mechanisms that allows this tree to have an optimal balance between photochemical, photoprotective and antioxidant performance.

These fibroblast lineages differ in location and function, and their cell identity and composition change with age (9, 10). While papillary fibroblasts beneath the basement membrane have an active Wnt signalling signature and are required for hair follicle formation, fibroblasts in the reticular dermal layer express high levels of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune signalling and mediate the initial phase of wound repair (7, 9, 11). During mouse skin development, dermal maturation is governed by a tight balance between fibroblast proliferation, quiescence and ECM deposition. Within the first week of postnatal life there is a coordinated switch in fibroblast behaviour from proliferative to quiescent, which is governed by ECM deposition/remodelling (12). While this quiescent state characterises postnatal skin, upon wounding, different fibroblast lineages are stimulated to proliferate and migrate into the wound site (13). Besides depositing/remodelling ECM in the wound bed, fibroblasts are able to acquire a dermal papilla or adipocyte fate in response to distinct signals and thereby promote hair follicle and DWAT regeneration, respectively (14\u201316).

In fibroblasts PGE-2 binding to EP4 has been shown to increase PTEN activity and Fas expression and decrease survivin expression, thereby promoting apoptosis (43).

Delile is an endemic and dominant seagrass species in the Mediterranean Sea, where it forms extensive meadows from the surface down to a maximum of about 45 m depth (Procaccini et al., 2003; Boudouresque et al., 2006). Seagrass meadows play major ecological roles by enhancing biodiversity, supporting high productivity, protecting the geomorphology of the coastline, sequestering global oceanic carbon and providing a buffering effect against ocean acidification (Duarte et al., 2005; Barbier et al., 2011; Fourqurean et al., 2017; Chou et al., 2018). However, seagrass ecosystems are currently suffering from a worldwide regression in response to several environmental stressors (Orth et al., 2006; Waycott et al., 2009; Marb\u00e0 and Duarte, 2010). For instance, the reduction in the surface coverage of P. oceanica has been reported to be 34% in the past 50 years (Telesca et al., 2015). Considering that P. oceanica is a climax, slow-growing seagrass species, natural and anthropogenic perturbations can be particularly critical, as their recovery from perturbations can be very slow or may not recover at all (Serrano et al., 2011). Among the threats that these ecosystems are facing, eutrophication from waste waters and aquaculture, shoreline constructions, anchoring and trawling, dredging, introduced species, and climate change (warming and sea-level rise) are considered major causes of the decline of P. oceanica meadows over the last decades (Boudouresque et al., 2009; Champenois and Borges, 2018). Most of these impacts potentially or ultimately reduce water transparency and, therefore, the quality and quantity of the irradiance reaching the seagrass canopy (Duarte et al., 2004; Orth et al., 2006). Epiphytic and planktonic algal accumulations from excess anthropogenic nutrients, increased sediment run-off, and resuspension of bottom sediments are primary causes of reduced underwater irradiance in coastal areas (Orth and Moore, 1983; Cambridge et al., 1986; Onuf, 1994). Ocean warming is also regarded as one of the most severe factors of global climate change, expected to cause, under extreme greenhouse gas emission scenarios, the rise of ocean surface temperatures between 2.6 \u00b0C and 4.8 \u00b0C by 2100, along with an increased amplitude and duration of heat waves (abnormally warm seawater episodes) (IPCC, 2014). These changes are predicted to have serious repercussions in the Mediterranean Sea given its confined nature, which makes it more susceptible to temperature increases, with warming occurring at significantly higher rates compared to open oceans (Diffenbaugh et al., 2007; Vargas-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2008; Calvo et al., 2011).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "229c7ae0-8d85-4ab3-a85d-3a7422162b64": {"text": "Generally, light and nutrients comprise the source of energy and matter needed for the growth of seagrasses, while temperature regulates biochemical processes involved in photosynthesis and respiration, thus, predominantly controlling the annual and seasonal production patterns of seagrasses (Lee and Dunton, 1996; Zupo et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2005, 2007). Water temperature and irradiance are usually correlated and display similar seasonal trends, making it difficult to isolate both environmental parameters in relation to seagrass growth and production (Kaldy and Dunton, 2000; Kaldy, 2006). Light requirements for seagrasses are unusually high, being approximately 10-37% of surface irradiance, compared to the 0.1-1% needed for most of the other marine macrophytes, that is partially attributed to inefficient carbon concentrating mechanisms for photosynthesis (Invers et al., 2001; Larkum et al., 2006; Zimmerman, 2006). In view of this, seagrasses are highly vulnerable to the deterioration of water clarity, which is evidenced through the reported large-scale losses of meadows worldwide (Dennison et al., 1993; Onuf, 1994; Short and Wyllie-Echeverria, 1996; Erftemeijer et al., 2006). Hence, understanding the light thresholds for seagrass survival is fundamental for an effective management of these valuable habitats (York et al., 2013). Elevated temperatures entail a grand risk of local extinction for cold-adapted plants, such as Mediterranean seagrasses, as they have visibly manifested physiological symptoms of heat stress and reduced fitness (Beca-Carretero et al., 2018; Mar\u00edn-Guirao et al., 2018). The consequences of heat waves can be notably damaging on seagrass meadows, promoting shoot mortality and population decline when critical temperature thresholds are surpassed (D\u00edaz-Almela et al., 2009; Marb\u00e0 and Duarte, 2010; Jord\u00e0 et al., 2012). In addition, thermal stress can induce the acceleration of the respiration over photosynthesis rates (Collier and Waycott, 2014; Mar\u00edn-Guirao et al., 2018), and affect important life history events, like reproduction, through increased flowering intensity (Ruiz et al., 2018; Mar\u00edn-Guirao et al., 2019).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "28c76814-b5d2-4857-adee-0fd0ba2a34fb": {"text": "Several studies have been carried out in order to determine the effects of light reduction on P. oceanica, comparing its response along bathymetric/spatial gradients (Alcoverro et al., 2001; Ruiz and Romero, 2003; Dattolo et al., 2014) and experimentally though the modification of the light environment with shading screens (Ruiz and Romero, 2001; Mazzuca et al., 2009; Serrano et al., 2011; Gacia et al., 2012). Investigations on the impacts of sea warming, considering climate change scenarios, have focused on its isolated effects (Marb\u00e0 and Duarte, 2010; Guerrero-Meseguer et al., 2017; Hern\u00e1n et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2018; Traboni et al., 2018) and the interaction with other stressors (Hendriks et al., 2017; Ontoria et al., 2019; Agawin et al., 2021). However, research on the combined effects of ocean warming and water turbidity in P. oceanica meadows remains relatively scarce and understanding them is crucial for the future management of these coastal ecosystems. Moreover, no studies have been done so far on the effect of these factors on the microorganisms associated with P. oceanica, such as the nitrogen (N2) fixers.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "3427ef2f-21b1-4858-95b2-b1e31077e942": {"text": "Biological N2 fixation, defined as the enzymatic reduction of atmospheric N2 to ammonium equivalents, takes part in significantly sustaining the high productivity of P. oceanica in the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea (Garcias-Bonet et al., 2019). Seagrasses harbor diverse communities of epi- and endophytic bacteria associated with their leaves, roots and rhizomes, that can enhance plant growth through increased nutrient availability, for instance, via N2 fixation or by mineralizing organic compounds (Uku et al., 2007; Cole and McGlathery, 2012; Garcias-Bonet et al., 2016). In particular, it has been reported that N2 fixation processes associated with the phyllosphere of P. oceanica could potentially supply the total nitrogen demand of the plant (Agawin et al. 2016; 2017). The enzyme complex that catalyzes the biological N2 fixation process is the nitrogenase, which is composed of two proteins: conventionally, the iron protein or nitrogenase reductase, and the molybdenum iron protein or nitrogenase (Hamisi, 2010). The nifH gene encodes the iron protein and the nifDK genes encode the molybdenum iron protein (Rubio and Ludden, 2002). Sequencing the nif genes, with nifH being the most sequenced and marker gene of choice, has allowed studying the phylogeny, diversity, and abundance of N2-fixing microorganisms (Gaby and Buckley, 2012). A significant diversity has been identified among marine diazotrophs, with filamentous organisms including primarily Trichodesmium sp. and the diatom symbiont Richelia intracellularis, and highly diverse unicellular diazotrophs that comprise Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Archaea (Moal et al., 2011). At present, three groups of unicellular N2-fixing cyanobacteria (UCYN) have been described: UCYN-A, B, and C (Zehr et al., 2001; Foster et al., 2007). Groups B and C are nanoplanktonic cells (2-10 \u03bcm) closely related to the cultivated strains Crocosphaera watsonii and Cyanothece sp., respectively (Church et al., 2005; Foster et al., 2007); whereas members of Group A are of picoplanktonic size (0.7-1.5 \u03bcm) and uncultivated up until now (Biegala and Raimbault, 2008; Goebel et al., 2008).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "c25fe31f-9d64-4e31-8d02-101655c50d85": {"text": "Nitrogenase activity is influenced by a combination of environmental factors that differ depending on the geographic region and diazotroph community composition (Mahaffey et al., 2005). Several studies have suggested a strong temperature dependence of the N2 fixation process at the enzymatic level, and a positive correlation to irradiance (Welsh, 2000; Brauer et al., 2013; Agawin et al., 2017; Garcias-Bonet et al., 2019). Furthermore, as the nitrogenase proteins require iron (Fe), the availability of both phosphorus (P) and Fe are factors that could limit or co-limit the N2 fixation process in some areas of the oceans (Sa\u00f1udo-Wilhelmy et al., 2001; Karl et al., 2002; Mills et al., 2004). Aquatic primary producers usually contain external alkaline phosphates; enzymes capable of hydrolyzing organic phosphorus compounds (monoester phosphates), which liberates inorganic phosphorus and increases the availability of this nutrient for growth (Kuenzler and Perras, 1965; Mart\u00ednez-Crego et al., 2006). Thus, the measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity has been employed as an indicator of phosphorus limitation and deficiency in algae and seagrasses (P\u00e9rez and Romero, 1993; Invers et al., 1995; Steinhart et al., 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ju\u00e1rez et al., 2019).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "f04355a8-65d9-4207-ac51-df305c27451e": {"text": "The purpose of this study was to assess the response P. oceanica and its N2 fixing community to different combinations of temperature and light levels, in terms of primary production and respiration rates, chlorophyll content, alkaline phosphatase activity, oxidative stress indicators and N2 fixation activities of the diazotrophs associated with different plant tissues.

Higher average pH(i.e. more alkaline conditions), occurred in the aquaria under high light treatments (Fig. 2B), possibly reflecting the greater buffering effect provided by the plants through increased photosynthesis (Hendriks et al., 2013). Seagrass meadows can induce diurnal variations in the seawater carbon chemistry in relation to their productivity, generally, through the uptake of CO2 during photosynthesis in the day and the release of CO2 with respiration at night (Chou et al., 2018; Howard et al., 2018). Hence, the more metabolically intense an ecosystem is, the greater their capacity to affect the seawater pH and alkalinity (Duarte et al., 2013; Hendriks et al., 2013). In addition, greater chlorophyll production has been denoted as a photo-acclimative response of P. oceanica meadows thriving under high light conditions, which implies an increase in the number of reaction centers and, consequently, in the capacity of photon absorption and electron flow rate along the transport chain (Frost-Christensen and Sand-Jensen, 1992; Ruban, 2009; Dattolo et al., 2014).

This could be partially attributed to the fact that, although the elevated temperature treatment applied in the aquaria was 1\u00b0C above the optimum conditions recorded for this seagrass (17-20\u00b0C), it stays within its temperature comfort range (13-24\u00b0C) (Boudouresque and Meinesz, 1982). However, significantly higher leaf net photosynthetic rates were still exhibited by plants subjected to 15.5 \u00b0C and high light treatment. On the other hand, in Agawin et al. (2021), positive responses to higher temperature were observed in the photosynthetic activity of P. oceanica, while leaf respiration rates did not increase, suggesting that ocean warming scenarios may not necessarily have adverse effects on the carbon balance of the plants in winter.

This suggests that, anthropogenic activities that cause prolonged periods of reduced surface irradiance will possibly have more destructive impacts in these ecosystems during winter, rather than the prospected sea warming in the Mediterranean. Similarly, Hendriks et al. (2017) reported that low light availability had a negative effect on the photosynthetic performance of P. oceanica under short-term experimental conditions for summer, while temperature negatively affected the plants growth. Champenois and Borges (2018) also highlighted the strong association between the GPP of P. oceanica and the interannual variations of light availability over a decade in Bay of Revellata, France, and a positive correlation to temperature, given that the temperatures recorded stayed within the comfort range of the seagrass species. Nevertheless, Serrano et al. (2011) demonstrated through in situ shading experiments in Portlligat Bay, Spain, that shallow P. oceanica meadows are more vulnerable to severe light limitation during spring-summer compared with autumn-winter, since it coincides with the plants\u2019 favorable growth season when they accumulate reserves for overwintering.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "261d8bfd-b5b0-40f8-8a6f-25afcee21523": {"text": "The biochemical responses of P. oceanica showed that young leaves subjected to the ambient temperature and high light treatment exhibited significantly higher ROS production, while top leaves demonstrated greater polyphenols content at elevated temperature. These observations coincide with studies that report how factors such as high irradiance and temperature may promote the production of ROS in photosynthetic organisms, that in excessive quantities leads to oxidative stress (Choo et al., 2004; Adams et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2015). In this study, the young leaves of P. oceanica, that were still in the process of development, might have been more vulnerable to the saturating light conditions, which possibly induced the elevated ROS concentrations detected. However, it should also be noted that high primary production rates unavoidably prompt the production of ROS (Hajiboland, 2014), since these free oxygen radicals are liberated when the photolysis of water molecules by the photosystem II (PSII) occurs during photosynthesis (Lesser, 2006). This corresponds with the significantly higher NPP rates reported for the young leaves at the ambient temperature and high light treatment, hence, the increased amounts of ROS perceived in these tissues could also be related to their high photosynthetic activity. For the top leaves, the higher phenolic compounds measured could be a response of the plants to the elevated temperatures they were exposed to, considering they were not optimum for their functioning and seagrasses, especially for P. oceanica which are sensitive to the quality of environmental conditions (Orth et al., 2006). Phenolic compounds demonstrate several biological functions that include antioxidant activity, and plants generally activate antioxidant mechanisms to detoxify the ROS generated and avoid oxidative stress (Cheynier et al., 2013; Costa et al., 2015). The higher mean values of ROS calculated for top leaves under elevated temperature compared to ambient treatments may support this notion, although the differences were not significant (p<0.05).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "8a599b8e-9425-4821-8702-b12678ddaca6": {"text": "The phosphatase activity in P. oceanica achieved its maximum values at elevated temperature and low light conditions, which is consistent with the patterns described by Invers et al. (1995), who demonstrated that increasing temperatures can positively affect APA rates in this seagrass until a certain threshold (24 \u00b0C). The high activity of this enzyme under elevated temperature and low light also matches the significantly enhanced N2 fixation rates exhibited by this treatment, considering that the energy, in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to fuel N2 fixation is dependent on the presence of inorganic phosphorus, therefore, the demand for this nutrient is theoretically induced when the cells are fixing N2 (Romano et al., 2017; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ju\u00e1rez et al., 2019). In contrast, the APA values were on average the lowest under equal temperature and saturating light, regardless of the more favorable pH values for the phosphatases in this treatment, as they were higher compared to the low light treatments. This result could be attributed to the fact that at the final stage of the experiment the mean phosphate concentration for this treatment was several orders of magnitude higher than the rest (Table 1), given that APA in seagrasses decreases under elevated phosphate content and, vice versa, increases with phosphorus limitation (Invers et al., 1995; Mart\u00ednez-Crego et al., 2006; Agawin et al., 2021). As for the significantly lower APA rates demonstrated by the rhizomes, this may suggest that the metabolic activity occurring in this part of the plants is relatively low compared to the others, consequently, its inorganic phosphorus demand is low as well. Generally, the phosphatase activity tends to be greater in the leaves, partially due to the contribution of the epiphytes (Invers et al., 1995).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tbl1"]}, "7b76ca03-fa70-4fca-90d7-f2e8e9c81634": {"text": "The N2 fixation rates estimated in the present study are relatively similar to those previously obtained by other works in P. oceanica meadows during winter (Agawin et al., 2017, 2019). Diazotrophic activity being significantly higher at elevated temperature and low light conditions could be attributed to the strong temperature dependency of the nitrogenase enzyme (Brauer et al., 2013; Agawin et al., 2017; Garcias-Bonet et al., 2019). Further, the low nitrate concentrations exhibited in this treatment at the final stage of the incubations (Table 1) may suggest the existence of dissolved inorganic nitrogen limitation, which possibly induce N2 fixing conditions in these aquaria. Nonetheless, N2 fixation was considerably lower under elevated temperature and saturating light conditions and this could be related to the significantly high GPP values measured for the leaves and phyllosphere of P. oceanica in these tanks. It has been widely documented that N2 fixation is an oxygen sensitive process, since molecular oxygen (O2) is capable of inactivating the nitrogenase and causing irreversible damage to the protein structure, as well as inhibiting the synthesis of the enzyme in many diazotrophs (Berman-Frank et al., 2003; Schoffman et al., 2016). Thus, increased O2 evolution with increased photosynthesis may affect negatively the N2 fixation activities associated with P. oceanica in treatments with increased GPP. Diazotrophic activity showed variability among plant parts, with the roots exhibiting higher average values, particularly the sterilized ones containing the root endophytes, in comparison to the leaves. These findings are consistent with the results of Lehnen et al. (2016) for P. oceanica and Hamisi et al. (2009) in tropical seagrass species. According to the latter authors, higher activities in the rhizosphere could be associated with a high occurrence of heterotrophic diazotrophs aside from the autotrophic bacteria in the phyllosphere. This pattern is also in agreement with the reported by Agawin et al.

(2017) indicated the presence of members of the UCYN-B, such as Crocosphaera, and UCYN-C, like Cyanothece, in addition to other genera of the phyla Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Archaea in the phyllosphere of P. oceanica. The UCYN-A (Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa) is regarded as one of the most abundant and widespread N2 fixing groups in the ocean, proved to live attached or in symbiosis with larger single-celled prymnesiophytes, given that they lack important biosynthetic pathways genes, including oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon fixation (Zehr et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2012). Considering its association with larger algae and the frequent symbioses between cyanobacteria and multicellular plants evidenced in terrestrial habitats (Thompson et al., 2012), the presence of this N2 fixing group in P. oceanica is also plausible. The diazotrophic communities identified showcased varied responses to the treatments, with UCYN-B demonstrating the maximum average of nifH expression overall at elevated temperature and limited light, while UCYN-C had significantly higher values compared to the rest under ambient temperature and low light conditions, although the highest means for this latter group alone were under both high light treatments. The UCYN-B group having enhanced activities at elevated temperatures is consistent, based on the literature (Brauer et al., 2013; Agawin et al., 2017), with the general positive correlation recorded between temperature and N2 fixation. Moreover, past studies have evidenced the thermophilic habit of Crocosphaera (UCYN-B), with warmer sea surface temperatures (26-29 \u00b0C) primarily determining its distribution across the oceans (Church et al., 2008; Moisander et al., 2010). The results obtained for UCYN-C might be due to the different light and temperature requirements its representatives possess, consequently, the species have optimum N2 fixation rates under distinct conditions. On the other hand, although it has been denoted that UCYN-A exhibits a broad temperature range, more associated with cooler waters and a lower temperature optimum than the remaining cyanobacterial groups (Moisander et al., 2010; Cabello et al., 2020), the results obtained from the experiment do not reflect a clear pattern.

Studies on low light Prochlorococcus have reported upper light limits that are similar to those we describe here for our diatom isolate (41).

However, centric diatoms are not typically considered to be part of the benthic community (although dormant resting stages can be observed)(45\u201347). Alternately, it could be that the low-light physiology of our Chaetoceros isolate is an adaptation to deeper layers of the photic zone, similar to low-light Prochlorococcus, but its consistent presence even in open ocean surface water samples from high latitudes does not support either conclusion. Another possibility is this diatom could be adapted to living under sea ice, where active photosynthesis can be maintained below 5 \u03bcmol photons m-2 sec-1 (48); however, this seems unlikely as temperate environments such as Narragansett Bay typically do not freeze over during the winter (49).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "46a97812-9dac-4d6e-a9e4-1e49e8418a23": {"text": "We also showed that at sub- or supraoptimal light levels, the maximum thermally-determined growth rate and the thermal optimum decrease.

For instance, in six years of amplicon data it was detected in ~45-80% of the samples taken between November and April, when temperatures are low and the days are relatively short. The frequency of detection in May could be explained by the fact that although day length is increasing, the waters in Narragansett Bay are still colder than summer and early fall conditions (mean = 15.5 \u00b12.7 \u00b0C). In the summer months (June through September) it was only detected 4 times.

Consequently, they may be even more abundant in polar waters than observed here. SST across theses samples was low (2.56 average \u00b13.7 \u00b0C) compared to Narragansett Bay; however, irradiance was likely much higher due to the near constant daylight experienced during the polar summer.

Under low light conditions, many diatoms photo-acclimate by increasing the size of their chloroplasts and the number of photosystems and antenna pigments they contain, in order to increase photon capture (55,56). It could be that our low-light Chaetoceros has a limited ability to adjust its photosynthetic energy acquisition systems when exposed to high light, causing a harmful buildup of ROS.

Phytoplankton associated with low light environments such as deep water or beneath sea ice are often specialized for utilizing these higher energy wavelengths (59,60). Blue light has also been suggested to trigger germination in the resting stages of marine diatoms, and has been associated with upregulation of proteins associated with photoprotection in Phaeodactylum tricornatum (61,62). At higher latitudes and during the winter, solar elevation is lower compared to low latitudes or during the summer. This results in a lower angle of incidence, which causes more light to be reflected from the ocean\u2019s surface; however, this process is skewed towards longer wavelengths, which are preferentially reflected (63). The implication is that phytoplankton at higher latitudes or during the winter season experience more blue light relative to red light.

In a shallow (8m), well mixed estuary such as Narragansett Bay this interaction between light and temperature may in fact shrink the range of months where growth of this diatom is feasible. For instance, it is frequently (appearing in > 40% of the samples) observed as late in the year as April and May, where day length is longer and solar elevation higher than during the winter months.

Mangrove wetlands are particularly susceptible to SLR because of their position between terrestrial and marine ecosystems (Field 1995, Ellison and Farnsworth 1997). Mangrove species have developed considerable variation in crucial life-history traits, such as rates of photosynthesis, water- and nutrient-use efficiencies, growth rates, and biomass allocation ratios in response to the interactions among resources (e.g., light and nutrients), regulators (e.g., salinity, sulfides), and inundation \u2013 Twilley and Rivera-Monroy 2005, Alongi 2008, Twilley and Rivera-Monroy 2009, Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2013).

The stunted physiognomy (i.e., reduced growth and development) of scrub mangroves results from severe nutrient (e.g., phosphorus, P) limitation, prolonged or permanent inundation with little tidal influence, and seasonal water stress (Feller 1995, Koch and Snedaker 1997, Cheeseman and Lovelock 2004, Medina et al. 2010). Scrub mangrove forests develop distinct landscape patterning, forming mangrove-island clusters with higher-elevations than their surrounding shallow open-water ponds and channels (Figure 1A). Soil elevation gradients result from differences in root biomass stocks and production, leaf litter accretion, and wood deposition (McKee et al. 2007, McKee 2011, Krauss et al. 2014). For example, in scrub mangrove-islands of the southeastern Florida Everglades, island center habitats have 66% more root biomass and 52% more root production than island edges (Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2011), which leads to spatial differences in soil elevation among island habitats. These differences in soil elevation interact with environmental gradients (e.g., hydroperiod, salinity) along the intertidal zone in complex ways to affect mangrove physiology (e.g., rates of net CO2 assimilation \u2013 A, growth rates, or sap flux) at variable scales (Medina and Francisco 1997, Twilley et al. 1998, Medina et al. 2010, Twilley et al. 2017).", "figure_ref": ["fig1"], "table_ref": []}, "545319aa-541f-46dd-a967-03f8c89317ec": {"text": "A) Photograph of TS/Ph-7 shows scrub R. mangle tree islands that characterize the study site.

Although mangrove species can tolerate flooded conditions, they are still susceptible to damage if plants become entirely submerged for days to weeks (Wanless 1998, Mendelssohn and McKee 2000, McKee 2011). Inundation stress typically decreases rates of leaf gas exchange (e.g., A, transpiration) and tree growth in mangroves (He et al. 2007, Cardona-Olarte et al. 2013). For example, greenhouse studies have revealed a 20% reduction in maximum A when mangrove seedlings and saplings were subjected to short-term intermittent seawater flooding (6 to 22 days, Krauss et al. 2006). Mangrove leaf gas exchange is further affected by how seawater flooding interacts with fresh water and nutrient inputs (Wolanski 1992). For instance, a significant reduction in stomatal conductance (g) and leaf water potential in Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. seedlings occurred when exposed to prolonged flooding for up to 80 days with 33% seawater compared to the control plants; however, seedlings flooded with fresh water for 80 days showed an increase in both parameters (Naidoo 1983). In contrast, seedlings of Avicennia germinans (L.) L. and Laguncularia racemosa (L.) C.F.Gaertn. exposed to permanent flooding with 23% seawater showed no change in g, A, or intrinsic water use efficiency (wue) but had reduced leaf area (Krauss et al. 2006). Hydrologic conditions can further negatively influence mangrove physiology through the interaction with soil phytotoxins (i.e., sulfides), produced as by-products of low oxygen availability and soil redox conditions due to permanent flooding, which can potentially depress water and nutrient uptake and affect rates of leaf gas exchange (Nickerson and Thibodeau 1985, McKee 1993, Ball 1996, Pezeshki and DeLaune 2012, Lamers et al. 2013). Regarding permanently inundated scrub mangroves, such as those in the southeastern Florida Everglades, how seasonal dynamics interact with inundation levels to influence leaf and forest carbon uptake dynamics is not entirely understood.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "1929986c-435f-4b8d-9e11-14914f60d936": {"text": "Mangroves are highly adapted to tolerate salt stress, yet salinity has the most significant impact on forest productivity, tree growth rates, and rates of leaf gas exchange. The adverse effects of increasing salinity are most evident along steep salinity gradients (i.e., those >30 ppt), particularly in dry environments (Lugo and Snedaker 1974, Cintron et al. 1978, Medina and Francisco 1997, Reef and Lovelock 2015). Salt stress variably affects mangrove tree physiology, depending on species-specific salt tolerance levels and mechanisms for processing salt (Parida and Jha 2010, Reef and Lovelock 2015). For example, R. mangle naturally inhabits Neotropical environments with salinities from near zero to around 35 ppt but may also be found in dry coastal environments with salinities up to 50-60 ppt (Cintron et al. 1978, Cardona-Olarte et al. 2006). All mangroves can exclude salt through the roots; however, R. mangle is a highly efficient salt excluder because its roots essentially prevent salt from entering the plant. Additionally, R. mangle lacks the excretory glands that other mangrove species (e.g., L. racemosa) use to excrete salt once it has entered the plant. As such, the xylem of R. mangle is 100 times less saline than seawater (Scholander et al. 1962, Scholander 1968, Medina and Francisco 1997, Tomlinson 2016) because of the Casparian strip (Lawton et al. 1981) and ultrafiltration by cell membranes in the thick aerenchyma and cortical layers of its root tissues (Field 1984, Werner and Stelzer 1990). However, some salt still enters the plant through the roots, which has a deleterious effect on the physiology of Rhizophora trees, causing decreases in growth and A rates, and water and nutrient use efficiencies (Ball 1988, Clough and Sim 1989, Lugo et al. 2007, Medina et al. 2010, Cardona-Olarte et al. 2013).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "44005be1-b4eb-4e53-83a8-a0139c7ed12c": {"text": "Mangrove A varies widely with the environment (e.g., water and salinity levels) and nutrient availability. A for R. mangle maximizes around 20 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 (Golley et al. 1962, Bjorkman et al. 1988, Lin and Sternberg 1992, Lovelock and Feller 2003, Lugo et al. 2007, Ball 2009); however, A for scrub mangroves is lower, generally ranging from <5 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 (Golley et al. 1962, Cheeseman et al. 1997, Cheeseman and Lovelock 2004) to roughly 13 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 (Lugo et al. 2007, Barr et al. 2009). A field study from Jobos Bay in southern Puerto Rico demonstrated a significant decrease in R. mangle A (from 12.7 to 7.9 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) and g (from 0.28 to 0.19 mol m-2 s-1) when comparing fringe habitats at 35 ppt salinity to inland salt flat habitats at 80 ppt (Lugo et al. 2007). Reductions in A and g were accompanied by changes in leaf morphology (i.e., smaller specific leaf area, SLA), reduced nutrient-use efficiency, and increased nutrient resorption, demonstrating how environmental effects on mangrove physiology can have consequences for within plant nutrient dynamics, and thus ecosystem functioning. Therefore, increasing salinity decreases A and g and increases intrinsic water use efficiency (wue, defined as A) in mangroves, with Rhizophora species exemplifying these trends (Ball 2009, Clough and Sim 1989). Moreover, the high salt tolerance of mangrove species leads to strong stomatal control, which creates dynamics between A and water use which depend on relative reduction in transpiration rates versus the degree to which leaves are biochemically limited to fix carbon (e.g., via RUBISCO carboxylation efficiency versus RUBP regeneration) at low stomatal conductance (Sobrado 2000, Lovelock and Feller 2003, Ball 2009). For instance, R. mangle has succulent leaves with lower wue than more salt-tolerant species (i.e., A. germinans or L. racemosa); however, R. mangle has greater water transport efficiency in stems than more salt-tolerant species (Sobrado 2000). Thus, when considering the effects of salinity on leaf gas exchange rates, plant water use must be considered in concert because both A and g decline similarly with increasing salinity, effectively creating co-limitation of photosynthesis at moderate to high salinities (Ball 2009).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "fd611ec1-d8a0-4e8e-8b5e-60a41a3e855c": {"text": "In mangrove wetlands of the Florida Everglades, variation in environmental gradients, including hydroperiod (e.g., duration of inundation) and soil P availability, control mangrove forest structure and function (e.g., biomass and litterfall production) across the coastal landscape (Chen and Twilley 1999; Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2011, 2013). Yet, how the interaction between water level dynamics and salinity affects mangrove leaf gas exchange rates in situ is not entirely understood. Experimental evidence using R. mangle seedlings from south Florida showed that inundation created a greater degree of physiological stress than salinity levels; however, salinity accelerated the adverse effects of inundation stress on leaf function over time (Cardona-Olarte et al. 2013). In contrast, other studies have reported no apparent effect of water levels or flooding duration on rates of mangrove gas exchange, although inundation duration decreased variability in leaf gas exchange measurements (Hoppe-Speer et al. 2011). Using Florida mangroves, Krauss et al. (2006) found that short-term intermittent flooding decreased rates of leaf gas exchange relative to unflooded or permanently flooded greenhouse-grown seedlings, but that for in situ established R. mangle saplings growing along a natural tidal inundation gradient along Shark River in the southwestern Everglades, flooding led to increases in A and wue. Permanent flooding leads to decreases in A and g rates in most wetland plants (Kozlowski 1997); however, how inundation dynamics interact with salinity along the intertidal zone to influence mangrove physiology at different spatial and temporal scales in south Florida mangroves remains largely unknown. Further, global change-driven SLR and saltwater intrusion in South Florida coupled to large-scale freshwater diversion have accelerated mangrove encroachment into inland freshwater wetlands over the past 60 years (Ross et al. 2000). As SLR continues, it is imperative to quantify the relative effects of inundation and salinity on mangrove physiology and subsequent ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon flux) in the region.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "4579c17d-6506-4d4d-be09-f6cd3384addd": {"text": "Here, we present a comprehensive, one-year analysis of the seasonal effects of salinity (surface and porewater) and water levels on leaf gas exchange rates of R. mangle scrub mangroves in southeastern Florida Everglades. We focused our sampling on mangrove-islands with noticeable micro-elevational differences to understand the magnitude of influence of water levels and salinity on R. mangle tree physiology between mangrove-island center and edge habitats. We addressed the following questions: (1) how do rates of leaf gas exchange (e.g., A, g) vary with mangrove-island micro-elevation (center vs. edge habitats)? (2) how does leaf gas exchange respond to seasonal changes in salinity and water levels? (3) how do water- and nutrient-use efficiencies of R. mangle leaves vary between mangrove-island center and edge habitats? We hypothesized that A would be greater for R. mangle leaves in higher-elevation center habitats than lower-elevation edges. We also expected that A should vary little with season and that seasonal variation in g would be less than variation in A, relative to the range of variability among leaves because of strong control on g and potential for decoupling to some degree between g and A Moreover, given that scrub mangroves in Taylor River basin are strongly limited by phosphorus (i.e., soil N:P = 102-109 \u2013 Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2013), R. mangle plants should have high rates of P resorption. Finally, we predicted that trees within mangrove-island centers function at a higher physiological level (i.e., with greater rates of A and less of a relative reduction in g) due to lower levels of inundation and salt stress, and should, therefore, have greater wue (Ball 2009) and higher relative rates of nutrient resorption (Lugo et al. 2007, Medina et al. 2010) than trees at island edges.

The interaction between season and habitat was marginally significant (F1,12 = 4.53, p = .055). Intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE) was calculated from leaf \u03b413C values; accordingly, WUE was greatest in mangrove-island centers during the dry season relative to all habitat-season combinations. Additionally, WUE was significantly lower in the wet season than the dry season (F1,12 = 18.88, p < .01, Table 3). Mean leaf bulk \u03b415N values were significantly higher (F1,12 = 19.66, p < .001) in the center habitats (\u22120.60 \u00b1 0.66\u2030) relative to the edge (\u22124.79 \u00b1 0.66\u2030), but there was no difference between seasons (F1,12 = 0.17, p > .05) and no interaction between season and island habitat (F1,12 = 0.58, p > .05, Table 3, Figure 5A).", "figure_ref": ["fig5", "fig5", "fig5"], "table_ref": ["tbl3", "tbl3", "tbl3", "tbl3", "tbl3"]}, "c914e161-29fd-4c61-a47d-c03cbba55c95": {"text": "Our first research question asked how mangrove-island habitat affects rates of leaf gas exchange.

However, contrary to our expectation, habitat driven-variation in leaf gas exchange rates was roughly equal to seasonal variation, with no apparent decoupling between A and g (Figure 2). Our second research question asked whether water levels or salinity exerted a more-substantial effect on mangrove leaf gas exchange in situ. Porewater salinities at TS/Ph-7 are relatively low (i.e., between 15 and 30 ppt), compared to the levels of salinity at which leaf gas exchange rates of R. mangle are negatively affected (i.e., salinities > 35 ppt) and did not vary considerably over time (Figures S1 & S2). Therefore, we conclude that inundation stress is the primary driver of variation in R. mangle leaf gas exchange rates. Lastly, we predicted that general physiological stress would be lower at island centers than island edge habitats, leading to increased wue and higher rates of nutrient resorption at centers relative to edges. Indeed, intrinsic water-use efficiency was greater at island centers than edge habitats, with results being consistent across gas exchange-measured wue and isotope-derived WUE. In addition, water levels modulated leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (Figure 3, Table 2), especially in the dry season.

The magnitude of variation in A that we report in this study is slightly larger than the magnitude of variation reported by Lin and Sternberg (1992), who found that A varied up to 2 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 between scrub and fringe R. mangle trees in the nearby Florida Keys. Furthermore, our A measurements with average values between 5.7 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 (edge habitat, wet season) and 10.2 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 (center habitat, dry season, Figure 2), are within the range of values reported for R. mangle interior scrub (5.3 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) and fringe (10 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) mangroves along a distinct zonation pattern in the intertidal zone at Twin Cays, Belize (Cheeseman and Lovelock 2004). Island center habitats may also support greater access to mixed soil-groundwater sources in the dry season facilitating higher leaf gas exchange rates because of increased freshwater availability, or a reduction in the energy demand for processing saline water (Ewe et al. 2007). Our results demonstrate the effect that higher-elevation center habitats at TS/Ph-7 have on alleviating inundation stress, which pervades scrub mangrove physiology, making trees growing in center habitats in the dry season physiologically comparable to fringe mangroves. Certainly, the stress relief is short-lived when water levels rise in the wet season (Table 2, Figure S1), and leaf gas exchange rates are depressed once more (Figure 2.

As precipitation and freshwater flow increased during the wet season, water levels increased, and mangrove-island centers experienced greater inundation levels (Figures S1 & S2), resulting in decreased A and g (Figure 3). A similar reduction in A and g was measured in mangrove-island edge habitats during the wet season (Figures 3 & 4). Although A was depressed in the wet season, the effect of inundation levels on reducing A was consistent across seasons (Figure 4). g showed a similar pattern to A, being highest in mangrove-island centers during the dry season (Figure 3).

Thus, photosynthetic demand for water is likely highest from April to May, at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the wet season. During this time, we measured lower water levels and porewater salinities relative to the peak wet season. Barr et al. (2009) recorded earlier diurnal and more considerable reductions in g during late May versus July or August for mangroves at Key Largo, evidencing the greatest water-limitation on photosynthesis occurs at the end of the dry season. Additionally, the greatest A rates for tall fringe mangroves in the southeastern Everglades occur during the dry season from March to May (Barr et al. 2009). The difference in surface water and porewater salinity (\u0394sw-pw) can be used as a proxy for tree transpiration (Reef and Lovelock 2015). Average \u0394sw-pw measured 10.7 and 8.1 ppt at mangrove-island edges in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, whereas it measured 7.8 and \u22120.3 in mangrove-island centers in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Indeed, measured transpiration was highest at the end of the dry season in March and April (Figure S3). Thus, photosynthetic demand for water is higher in the dry season in mangrove-island centers relative to edges or either habitat in the wet season. The drying of the soils at slightly higher-elevation island center habitats in this scrub mangrove forest likely facilitates increases in A. Therefore, the seasonal variation in hydrology, mainly reductions in water levels and porewater salinity during the dry season, albeit coupled with an increase in surface water salinity in this study (Table 2), likely have critical consequences for mangrove forest carbon fluxes at greater spatial scales. Potentially drying soils could also lead to an increase in ecosystem respiration (Chambers et al. 2014), or non-stomatal derived CO2 uptake (Reef and Lovelock 2015). Future research could look at soil metabolic dynamics (e.g., soil respiration, microbial C and N, or changes in microbial communities) with hydrology and season, which may show unique responses in this scrub R. mangle forest (Lovelock 2008, Chambers et al. 2014).", "figure_ref": ["fig1"], "table_ref": ["tbl2"]}, "92adf5f6-16a5-4dcb-ba69-a5877e97b245": {"text": "During 2019, the hydrological environment (Figure 1C, D) at our study site was seasonally dynamic (Table 2) and tended to mirror patterns in local rainfall (Figure 1B). Water levels and porewater salinity both increased during the wet season (Table 2, Figure S1) from the beginning of the rainy season in May through November. This likely led to increased water column stratification via a larger freshwater lens (Hughes et al. 1998, Uncles et al. 1992). Indeed, the difference in surface water and porewater salinity increased in the wet season, with surface water salinities decreasing, despite a slight increase in porewater salinities (Table 2, Figure S1). When data were grouped by season, edge habitats were slightly more saline (about 4 ppt on average) than mangrove centers (Table 2), and there were no apparent differences between fringe and interior scrub mangrove zones (Figures S1 & S2). Comparing these changes in the hydrological environment with previous years, long-term water level and porewater salinity data at this site show that water level usually increases and porewater salinity usually decreases in the wet season relative to the dry season (Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2013). We measured the opposite trend for porewater salinity in 2019 with slight differences between seasons, likely because it was a wet year.

Porewater salinity was only included in the linear mixed-effects models for A and g, and its marginal effect was minimal, slightly increasing A by about 0.1 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 per ppt increase in porewater salinity. Like the effect of porewater salinity on A, the effect of porewater salinity on g was small in magnitude and consistent across seasons and mangrove-island habitats but was not statistically significant (Figure 4). The minimal influence of porewater salinity on leaf gas exchange is likely due to the minor seasonal and spatial variation in salinity that we measured during 2019. Differences were not large, maximizing at 16.4 ppt and averaging 5.2 ppt, especially when considering that R. mangle frequently occupies natural habitats with salinities greater than seawater (Reef and Lovelock 2015), potentially up to 50-60 ppt (Cintron et al. 1978). At our study site, variation in porewater salinity from long-term monitoring data (2001-2020) has shown similar magnitudes of relatively-minor variation in porewater salinity, with overall mean values ranging from 19-22 and rarely exceeding 30 ppt (Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2013). Additionally, long-term variation in porewater salinity (<30 ppt) across the FCE mangrove sites (Shark and Taylor River sites) is below the critical value of 65 ppt that influences forest structure and productivity across the FCE landscape (Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2013). Thus, the limited effect of salinity in our linear mixed-effects models is likely broadly indicative of relatively weak salinity effects in both scrub and tall R. mangle-dominated forests of the Everglades. This is a significant finding, given that these scrub forests are adapted to relatively low salinities. If salinity increases greatly due to SLR and saltwater intrusion in the region, they will likely experience more stressful conditions with could diminish their physiological performance, as observed in other studies in the neotropics (Lugo et al. 2007).", "figure_ref": ["fig4"], "table_ref": []}, "298f21d2-8cd4-43f0-99cf-c15bd77dad68": {"text": "The effects of inundation on R. mangle photosynthesis can be difficult to separate from the effects of salinity; however, the linear mixed modeling approach we used permitted doing so. We found that the intermittent flooding conditions of mangrove-island centers that averaged 10-15 cm above the soil surface allowed greater A and g than permanently flooded mangrove-island edges, which averaged 30-40 cm water levels. This indicates that the hydrological regime in center habitats allows mangrove soils to repeatedly flood and desiccate, which may help the species maintain optimal stem water potentials and g (Ball 2009, Reef and Lovelock 2015). In typical greenhouse experiments where mangrove seedlings are grown, inundation alone has little effect on photosynthetic rates or biomass production (Pezeshki et al. 1990b, Hoppe-Speer et al. 2011). However, inundation may sometimes lead to increases in leaf gas exchange rates over the short term and often interacts with salinity over time to reduce A, g and growth rates (e.g., Cardona-Olarte et al. 2013). Thus, water levels and flooding duration are key drivers controlling A in mangroves, and mangroves seem to physiologically\\ optimize photosynthesis to water levels. For instance, findings from a long-term greenhouse inundation study by Farnsworth and Ellison (1996) exemplify how short-term responses of R. mangle to inundation differ from longer-term responses. Over several years, high inundation levels led to steady declines in A of up 25% for a given g and decreases in growth rates. Results of the high-water level (30-40 cm above soil surface) treatment were similar to those of the low water level (10-15 cm) treatment, suggesting that R. mangle physiology is optimized at inundation levels that reach just a few centimeters above the soil surface at high water level (Ellison and Farnsworth 1997). Further research could assess the coupled effect of the depth and duration of flooding with salinity in the FCE by characterizing photosynthetic rates across a landscape-scale gradient that encompassed multiple sites and a broad range of salinity (or potentially with an experimental increase of salinity).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "85c389ae-2237-4141-93a3-4f0b71bce28b": {"text": "Although initial increases in R. mangle g can result from short term inundation (Krauss et al. 2006, Hoope-Speer et al. 2011), especially at low salinities (Pezeshki et al. 1990b), several studies have linked stomatal closure to longer-term inundation (Kozlowski 1997, Ellison and Farnsworth 1997). We measured depressed g during the wet season and in mangrove-island edge habitats relative to centers; however, this was not attributable to water levels after accounting for variation in seasonality and habitat, in that g increased with increasing water levels during the wet season. Our measurements of g were consistent with those reported in other studies from across a range of inundation levels (Clough and Sim 1989, Lin and Sternberg 1992, Ellison and Farnsworth 1997, Krauss et al. 2006, Lugo et al. 2007, Barr et al. 2009), supporting the understanding that R. mangle leaves limit g in response to flooding. Limits on g seek to optimize c for carbon gain without losing unnecessary amounts of water, but our findings show that g can increase with freshwater inputs, resulting in a decrease in c as A increases (Figure 3), likely because of faster Calvin cycle reactions (see supplemental information Figure S9). Interestingly, the scrub R. mangle leaves of TS/Ph-7 operate with low c concentrations (range = 220-260 \u00b5mol mol-1), which suggests pervasive inundation stress.

Our findings are roughly comparable to N and P resorption efficiencies for R. mangle in the control plots of scrub-dominated forests in Panama (\u223c50%, and 80%, respectively; Lovelock et al. 2004). Resorption of nutrients from senescent leaves before leaf fall is a within-stand nutrient recycling mechanism that may reduce nutrient losses via tidal export in coastal systems (Vitousek 1982, Aerts and Chapin 2002). Like other tropical trees, mangroves exhibit several physiological mechanisms that reduce nutrient losses via tidal exchange, including resorption of N and P before leaf abscission, which can lead to increased availability of limiting nutrients and ultimately change nutrient use and conservation patterns (Twilley et al. 1986, Alongi et al. 1992, Feller et al. 2003a, 2003b).", "figure_ref": ["fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "7738e82b-17e1-4175-961b-163bebf34250": {"text": "Our findings suggest that R. mangle conserves P better than N in this P-limited environment and indicate that canopy N and P resorption efficiency at TS/Ph-7 potentially results from the differential acquisition of these nutrients from the soil between habitats, and variation in the use of these nutrients among leaf stages. Mangrove species prioritize resorption of nutrients that are limited in the soil, and it has been suggested that plants growing in nutrient-poor environments resorb a higher proportion of nutrients, potentially decreasing nutrient loss by efficient nutrient recycling (Chapin and Moilanen 1991). At our study site, low soil TP concentrations probably determine the higher recycling efficiency of P relative to N. Indeed, soil TP concentrations in the upper 50 cm of soil at TS/Ph-7 (0.06 \u00b1 0.004 mg cm-3) are three times lower than soils at the mouth of Shark River estuary (SRS-6), which is dominated by fertile well-developed tall riverine mangroves. Such low TP concentrations result in extreme P limitation at TS/Ph-7 with average soil N:P ratios of 102 \u00b1 6 (Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al. 2013). Therefore, the heterogeneous distribution of essential nutrients within mangrove habitats creates distinct nutrient gradients and hot spots along the intertidal zone, influencing the efficiency of internal nutrient recycling. This is supported by observations that nutrient resorption efficiencies in mangroves vary with nutrient availability, e.g., via nutrient addition (Feller et al. 1999, Feller et al. 2003b) or along natural fertility gradients (Medina et al. 2010).

For example, a direct relationship between 15N discrimination and leaf N:P ratios of R. mangle leaves previously reported for the six FCE mangrove sites, including our study site, indicates that leaf N:P ratios accounted for 70% of the variability in 15N discrimination (Mancera-Pineda et al. 2009). Thus, foliar 15N composition can reflect in situ leaf N-status and differences in plant N-use. Hypoxic conditions in the soil may inhibit denitrification and ammonia volatilization, two processes that enrich the soil substrate in 15N (Craine et al. 2015). Therefore, the substrate should be less enriched at mangrove-island edges relative to their centers, because of interactions with the soil and the open water channels, which can alleviate hypoxia. Thus, it appears that more negative 15N values in the edge habitats may be associated with lower inorganic N (i.e., porewater ammonium) use by edge mangrove trees compared to those in center island habitats (Fry et al. 2000). However, our results contrast slightly with those of Mancera-Pineda et al. (2009), who reported mean \u03b415N values of +3 from 65 mature leaves collected in 2001 at our study site. We posit that differences in \u03b415N values between the two studies could be attributed to the location where leaves were collected during the 2009 study, concluding that it is very likely that Mancera-Pineda et al. only collected leaves from the center of mangrove-islands, avoiding edge habitats. Taking this into consideration, mangrove-island centers potentially may have even more-positive \u03b415N signatures than we found, illustrating that in the center of mangrove-islands, N is taken up by roots in inorganic soluble forms (e.g., porewater ammonium, nitrate) and not biotically via root symbionts.", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "18ad3de7-4ff5-421c-b206-b9d3d5d7842b": {"text": "Another potential explanation of why \u03b415N values were more negative at mangrove-island edges than in their centers is because lateral surface roots of R. mangle can extend into open water where they associate with symbiotic biofilms (i.e., algae and aquatic bacteria) that facilitate N acquisition from open water (Potts 1979). A significant source of isotopic discrimination occurs during N transfer between belowground symbionts (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi or bacteria) and plant roots during nitrification, denitrification, and ammonia volatilization. The lighter isotope 14N reacts faster than 15N (i.e., it is preferentially given to the host plant by the symbiont) so that plant tissues are depleted while substrates are enriched (H\u00f6gberg 1997, Robinson 2001). Indeed, at our study site, we observed several long, absorptive, fine lateral root systems that protruded from the edge of mangrove-islands into the open water ponds, which were colonized by algal biofilms. Mangrove trees can potentially adapt to nutrient shortage or localized nutrient deficiencies in the soil by altering patterns of nutrient use. This plant strategy may maximize the efficiency of capturing limiting resources essential for growth (e.g., N, P) from soil or surrounding open water areas in nutrient-poor environments such as Taylor River, as proposed by the optimal plant allocation theory (Chapin et al. 1987, Gleeson and Tilman 1992). We observed a slight decrease in foliar \u03b415N during the wet season (Figure 5A, Table 3) as water levels and porewater salinity increased, suggesting that N-acquisition by R. mangle via algal biofilms may be slightly greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Lastly, highly depleted (i.e., negative) N-isotope values in leaf tissues are characteristic of tropical wetlands with P limitation because P limitation increases N fractionation, especially in flooded wetlands with limited P pedogenesis (McKee et al. 2002, Troxler 2007, Medina et al. 2008). This is likely the case with the scrub R. mangle forest at TS/Ph-7, where the main source of P is brackish groundwater discharge (Price et al. 2006).

The most extensive accounts come from the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, whose diel coordination of carbohydrate and cell cycle pathways was shown to be strongly affected by iron availability and for which the first diatom circadian regulator was recently characterized [9, 10, 11]. Furthermore, studies thus far have focused solely on planktonic diatom species, which typically inhabit well-mixed water columns. In contrast, no data are available on diurnal variation in gene expression of the extraordinarily diverse group of benthic pennate diatoms, dominating some of the most productive ecosystems on the globe [12, 13, 14]. Yet, benthic ecosystems are exposed to dynamic and often extreme light regimes, resulting from the combined effects of tidal phasing, sediment composition and water column turbidity [15, 16, 17]. Under laboratory conditions, benthic diatom species generally show maximal growth rates at irradiances of 10-50 \u03bcE m\u22122 s\u22121, similar to conditions of shading that are periodically encountered in benthic communities [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Not only light availability varies over the course of the diel cycle, also nutrient and oxygen availability in the sediment show rhythmic patterns [23, 24], adding to the complexity and dynamic nature of benthic habitats. Motile species from the raphid pennate diatom clade are particularly successful in these environments and use the secretion of mucilaginous exopolysaccharides (EPS) to actively migrate through the sediment at dusk and dawn to maximize photosynthesis while avoiding excessive grazing [24, 25, 26, 27].

In culture, S. robusta cells display typical benthic behaviour, including surface attachment, biofilm formation and vigorous gliding motility, which has been exploited to study chemotaxis [31]. Cultures from strain 85A have been popular for transcriptomics experiments [32, 33, 34, 35].

Many aspects of the physiology of S. robusta appear to be tied to light availability and diurnal cycles. Prolonged darkness followed by illumination causes synchronization in cell cycle progression, chloroplast repositioning, pigment synthesis and sexual reproduction [38, 39]. Furthermore, S. robusta responds to high irradiances both by downwards migration into the sediment and the expression of photoprotective LHCX genes [40, 41].

The higher level of rhythmicity of S. robusta\u2019s transcriptome might be explained by the longer duration of the time series or experimental confounders such as light intensity and cell density.

In contrast to protein-coding genes, the majority of all lincRNAs (5,437, 76.4%) was not diurnally expressed.

In these distantly related microalgae, CBB cycle genes are also phasing at dawn or during the first half of the day, followed by light harvesting genes peaking at midday and TCA cycle enzymes at nightfall. Even the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechocystis follow the same diurnal sequence [61, 66, 67].

Coordinated cell cycle progression during the diel cycle has been observed in all major groups of microalgae, suggesting an evolutionary advantage such as the temporal separation of growth and cell division [4, 49, 68, 69]. The expression of the S. robusta homolog of the P. tricornutum G1 re-entry gene dsCyc2 at ZT2 implies that a majority of cells start the day in the G1 phase while the G1-associated cyclin-dependent kinase CDKA1 phased at ZT10 [70, 71]. G1/S transition and S phase marker genes were phasing at ZT14 with an additional peak the second day at ZT2, the latter indicating a secondary round of cell cycling, a subpopulation dividing during the day or organelle DNA replication (Fig. 5a). Although care was taken to avoid nocturnal light contamination, we cannot exclude that the additional S phase peak is caused by the presence of very low background light the first night. Flow cytometry revealed that each peak in S phase expression is followed by an increase in cells with a duplicated genome 4h later (Fig. 5a \u201cG2/M phase cells\u201d). Following genome replication, chromosome assembly markers and the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase CDKA2 [72] were maximally expressed at ZT14, while markers for metaphase-to-anaphase transition such as the anaphase promoting complex APC/C activator cdc20 [73] phased at ZT18 (Fig. 5a). Cell division was mainly restricted to the night, with the proportion of doublets (dividing cells) peaking at ZT18 and ZT22 and cell density almost doubling overnight (80% increase, Suppl. Fig. 11). Remarkably, while S phase markers and flow cy-tometry indicated a secondary round of cycling restricted to the second day, such an extra peak was not supported by mitotic and cytokinetic marker genes or an increase in the cell number (Fig. 5a, Suppl.

This is reflected in the expression of S phase genes in the afternoon and at dusk in transcriptomes of N. oceanica, O. tauri, P. tricornutum, and C. reinhardtii [3, 9, 10, 49, 50, 68]. Subsequently, mitosis and cell division in these species take place at dusk or during the first half of the night. In S. robusta, the expression of cell cycle markers appears to be slightly delayed compared these other microalgae: genes encoding S phase machinery peaked at ZT14 (compared to ZT9 in P. tricornutum) and cytokinesis predominantly occurred at ZT18 and ZT22 (Fig. 3b \u201cF\u201d, Fig. 5a). Given the relatively low irradiance used in our experiment, the delay of S phase onset might be explained by the existence of a G1 phase commitment point which allows progression through the cell cycle only when sufficient photosynthetic energy has been captured. A dependence of S phase timing on light intensity in the pre-commitment period has been found in green algae but such a commitment point has not yet been demonstrated in diatoms [76, 77]. In addition, cell cycle progression in natural conditions might be restricted until cells have migrated at dusk, as was observed for several other species of motile benthic diatoms [25, 51].", "figure_ref": ["fig3", "fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "d0592f04-01de-4a45-83e1-707e67de5bdc": {"text": "A combination of phylogenetics and transit peptide prediction revealed that genes encoding bacterial division-like proteins were targeted to the chloroplast and the mitochondrion (Fig. 5b, Suppl. Fig. 12-13), pointing to the retention of an ancestral system for mitochondrial division in S. robusta, as was observed in various proists, including diatoms but with the notable exception of P. tricornutum [78, 79, 80]. While the eukaryotic chloroplast division gene DRP5B (Suppl. Fig. 14) was phasing at ZT14 in accordance with autonomous chloroplast division being coordinated to the S-G2 phases of the cell cycle [38], all three bacterial-derived chloroplastic FstZ genes showed a maximum expression at ZT2 with additional expression at night (Fig. 5b). The discrepancy between the timing of FtsZ expression and chloroplast division in S. robusta is highly unusual, given that the FtsZ peak of expression is coordinated with chloroplast division in other microalgae such as O. tauri and Cyanidioschyzon merolae [50, 81]. Moreover, FtsZ and DRP5B peaked simultaneously in the afternoon in N. oceanica, and chloroplast division was coordinated with nuclear division in the related species Nannochloropsis oculata [82, 49]. It is worth noting that the stramenopile chloroplast is surrounded by four membranes, of which the outermost is continuous with the nuclear envelope [83]. Fission of the outer chloroplast membrane of the pennate diatom P. tricornutum only occurs after the three inner membranes have bisected the chloroplast [83]. This suggests an independent (FtsZ-free) division mechanism for the outermost membrane, and implies a coordination with nuclear division like in N. oculata [82].", "figure_ref": ["fig5", "fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "3720431a-0dd7-44fc-8c8d-8d66b1bc6e3f": {"text": "All mitochondrial FtsZ and Min-system division genes were significantly rhythmic and showed a consistent daily burst at ZT14 and ZT18 (Fig. 5b), suggesting that mitochondria either divide in coordination with maximal respiration at night, or with the cell cycle as was observed in the red alga C. merolae [81] and suggested in P. tricornutum [84].", "figure_ref": ["fig5"], "table_ref": []}, "b4c07b42-8c22-444b-8a68-64697183bdee": {"text": "The peak of cytokinesis at ZT18/ZT22 coincided with the expression of rhythmic genes involved in cell wall formation, which takes placed in a specialized intracellular compartment termed the silica deposition vesicle (SDV): 23 SDV-acidifying V-type ATPases, 11 SDV transmembrane silicanin-like genes, 24 diatom-specific SET domain protein methyltransferases (BacSETs), eight S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-aminopropyltransferase (AMDC-APT) genes, four silicic acid transporters and 28 genes from the frustulin family were phasing predominantly at ZT18 (Fig. 5a). Notably, an 11-transmembrane S. robusta homolog of the plant Silicon efflux transporter Lsi2 was also co-expressed at ZT18. This gene was downregulated during nutrient depletion and pheromone induced cell cycle arrest, supporting a role as an additional type of silicic acid transporter in diatoms as was hypothesized in T. pseudonana (Suppl. Fig. 15) [85]. The majority (82/113) of the cell wall genes was of diatom-specific age in our phylostratigraphic analysis, indicating that silica cell wall biosynthetic machinery might have evolved de novo in a common ancestor of the diatoms and the pico-eukaryotic sister group Bolidophyceae [86]. The over-representation of uncharacterized, diatom-specific genes phasing simultaneously with known cell wall formation factors suggests that hitherto unknown cell wall biosynthesis gene families are active at ZT18 (Fig. 2a). T. pseudonana, the best established model for cell wall biogenesis, displayed a lower expression of cell wall biosynthesis genes under silicon depletion conditions [85, 87]. Inspection of genes downregulated after silicon depletion in S. robusta yielded a significant association with genes phasing at ZT18 (q < 0.05). Among the top six diatom-specific families in this dataset, we observed the known cell wall associated frustulins and silicanins as well as four new candidate cell wall formation families that we termed Siren1-4 (\u201cSilica responsive night\u201d, Fig. 6). The presence of a predicted signal peptide in Siren1 and Siren3 proteins supports a possible role in cell wall formation, as a signal peptide is required for SDV protein targeting (Suppl. Fig. 16) [88, 85]. Although Siren2 and Siren4 do not possess a characteristic signal peptide and therefore may rather be involved in other processes such as late-stage mitosis, they may also participate in cytosolic processes that are suggested to influence silica morphogenesis [89, 90]. Siren1 and Siren4 genes do not contain known protein domains, but Siren2 and Siren3 were annotated with ankyrin repeats and an alpha/beta hydrolase fold domain, respectively. During cell wall synthesis, the protein-interacting ankyrin repeats in the Siren2 family may regulate cytoskeletal organization or cell cycle progression, processes these motifs are often involved in [91]. Over the years, numerous proteins associated with diatom cell wall biosynthesis (e.g. silaffins, cingulins and silacidins) have been proposed, but only a handful have a broad distribution across diatoms, most notably the silicanins, frustulins, p150 proteins and BacSETs [88]. We expand this list with the putative Siren3 and Siren4 cell wall families which are shared among pennate and centric diatoms (Fig. 6). Homologs of Siren1 and Siren2, on the other hand, appeared to be uniquely present in pennate diatoms, which is exciting as no pennate-specific cell wall associated proteins have been described to date (Fig. 6) [88].", "figure_ref": ["fig5", "fig2", "fig6", "fig6", "fig6"], "table_ref": []}, "8b4d41f3-f94f-4d87-973b-71f86cb6612a": {"text": "The PLAZA Diatoms 1.0 family ID and description of six gene families are given on the left hand side, with unknown families being termed \u201cSiren\u201d (Silica responsive night).

In S. robusta, we identified 13 bHLH TFs, of which 10 contained a PAS domain, which is in stark contrast to P. tricornutum, encoding only three bHLH-PAS [11]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each P. tricornutum bHLH TF corresponded to one S. robusta ortholog, except for bHLH2-PAS which expanded into seven gene copies (Fig. 7).

In diatoms, such genes have been implicated in the production of EPS, which are typically produced during migration and adhesion [100, 101, 102]. The semidiurnal expression of these genes might be linked to twice-daily vertical migration in subtidal and intertidal diatom communities, where diatoms burrow into the sediment at dusk and emerge at dawn [24, 25, 103]. Alternatively, semidiurnal rhythmicity may be an adaptation to the occurrence of tides in coastal benthic ecosystems, as there is typically a period of 12.4h from one high tide to the next one, and tides were observed to induce cyclic migration patterns in intertidal diatoms [24, 104, 105]. In several coastal animals, gene expression with a 12-h period has already been attributed to tidality [106, 107]. Nonetheless, our laboratory experiment did not allow for vertical migration and did not simulate tidality, making it hard to attribute this semidiurnal phenomenon to any of these scenarios.

System-specific physiological consequences of polyploidy, identified through comparisons between polyploids and related diploids have also been shown, for example, increased salt-tolerance (Chao et al. 2013), alterations in water-use efficiency (Garbutt and Bazzaz 1983), and in photosynthetic activity (e.g., Coate et al. 2012). Such outcomes may allow neopolyploids to range more broadly over the adaptive landscape and access adaptive peaks that would otherwise be unattainable through incremental changes at the diploid level. Early-generation, established polyploids can exhibit larger distributions than their lower ploidy progenitors, especially in habitats that feature less interspecies competition, for example, previously-glaciated regions (Stebbins 1971; Novikova et al. 2018; Rice et al. 2019).

In addition, the sympatric populations essentially remain binary from the point of view of ecological conditions (Paun et al. 2010; Paun et al. 2011; Balao et al. 2016).", "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, "eb7e265b-ce59-4685-a05a-66b55d823a91": {"text": "Differential gene expression tests revealed that 316 genes (2.5% of those retained after count-per-million based filtering) were significantly overexpressed in D. majalis, and 343 (2.7% of retained genes) significantly over-expressed in D. traunsteineri (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S4). Photosynthesis (GO: 0015979) and related processes were by far the most affected by differential expression between D. majalis and D. traunsteineri (Supplementary Table S3). In particular, relative to D. majalis, D. traunsteineri shows an increased expression of the Lhcb1-Lhcb4 antenna proteins that are part of the light-harvesting complex (LHC), which captures and delivers excitation to photosystems (Fig. 3B; Li et al. 2004). The LHC overexpression in D. traunsteineri may be linked to a lower relative chlorophyll content compared to D. majalis (see below). Also, overexpressed in D. traunsteineri are several components of the oxygen-evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII; Fig. 3B) that are responsible for catalysing the cleavage of water to oxygen, protons and electrons (Raymond and Blankenship 2004). Dactylorhiza traunsteineri has also higher expression in the Photosystem I (PSI) reaction centres II (psaD), III (psaF), V (psaG), XI (psaL), N (psaN), and O (psaO) (Fig. 3B), which are mediating the primary function of the PSI (i.e., electron transfer from plastocyanin to ferredoxin; Jensen et al. 2004). Notably, 10.9% of the differentially expressed genes (i.e., mostly over-expressed in D. traunsteineri) are involved in oxidation-reduction, a process that also shows one of the strongest over-representations in the enrichment test (Fig. 3A). Finally, also related to photosynthesis, genes linked to lightharvesting in PSI, chlorophyll biosynthesis processes, response to blue light, and response to light stimulus are overexpressed in D. traunsteineri compared to D. majalis (Fig. 3A).", "figure_ref": ["fig3", "fig3", "fig3", "fig3", "fig3", "fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "0d9012bd-b424-475a-a184-f77592e98f51": {"text": "To complement the transcriptomic and ecological results presented above, and confirm the photosynthetic differences recovered via RNA-seq, we phenotyped multiple accessions of both allopolyploids in the wild for leaf photosynthetic parameters using a MultispeQ v.1.0 (Kuhlgert et al. 2016).

This could reflect the specific nutrient poor soils preferred by D. traunsteineri and the nitrogen deficiency quantified in its leaves, as nitrogen is required for chlorophyll synthesis. It is of relevance here to note that we had observed in the RNA-seq results in common garden conditions overexpression of light harvesting proteins (Fig. 3) of D. traunsteineri compared to D. majalis. As D. traunsteineri prefers poor soils (Fig. 1A), it is likely that chlorophyll deficiency became ameliorated by an increased activity of light harvesting proteins. Such alterations to light harvesting complexes may make the regulation of captured light more difficult. In the wild, D. traunsteineri used 82.0 \u00b5mol photons\u2217 m\u22122 \u2217 s\u22121 \u00b1 38.7 more incoming light (400 nm to 700 nm) to drive photosynthesis (PAR), compared to D. majalis. However, the quantum yield (Phi2), i.e., the number of excited electrons that go into the Photosystem II, was significantly lower in D. traunsteineri than in D. majalis. Altogether, the amount of incoming light regulated away from photosynthetic processes in order to reduce damage to the plant (i.e., non-photochemical quenching, phiNPQ) was also significantly higher in D. traunsteineri (Fig. 4). The increased phiNPQ in D. traunsteineri compared to D. majalis is also likely reflected in the overexpression of oxidation-reduction processes (strongly enriched in differential expression tests; Fig. 3A), with a role in coping with residual oxygen radicals. This suggests that D. traunsteineri needs to implement a stronger photoprotective strategy to regulate its photosynthetic activity via quenching, potentially due to the limiting amount of chlorophyll, itself likely reflecting a deficiency of nitrate and other nutrients at those respective sites (Demmig-Adams and Adams 2006; Lopez-Jurado et al. 2020).", "figure_ref": ["fig4", "fig3", "fig1", "fig4", "fig3"], "table_ref": []}, "afc9087f-848a-444b-99f3-ac65be7eeef6": {"text": "Finally, we measured leaf stomatal conductance for water and net CO2 exchange in a controlled lab environment using a portable gas exchange fluorescence system GFS-3000 (Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). We found that both species maintained their stomata open during night-time, and hence gas exchange through stomata occurred throughout the night (Fig. 5), likely using evapotranspiration to maintain xylem transport to accommodate for nutrient scarcity. During the night, D. majalis showed a negative net CO2 (i.e., a release of CO2) in contrast to D. traunsteineri. In addition, during daytime D. traunsteineri transpires ca 20% less water, and this higher water-usage efficiency complements a ca 50% higher CO2 net assimilation rate compared to D. majalis. What this means for the enzyme apparatus and the light to energy conversion of the species needs to be elucidated in future research.

The levels of stomatal conductance and CO2 exchange fluctuate with a twelve-hour day/night cycle. Stomatal conductance is lower in D. traunsteineri which shows that its leaves do not open stomata as much as D. majalis, resulting in less water loss (higher water use efficiency) for nutrient acquisition via xylem. At night, the net CO2 exchange is slightly negative for D. majalis (red arrow) meaning that it releases more CO2 through respiration during nighttime, in contrast to D. traunsteineri (blue arrow), which also features 50% higher CO2 assimilation rate during daytime.

Despite the frequent gene flow between the two allotetraploids (Hedr\u00e9n et al. 2008; Balao et al. 2016; Brandrud et al. 2020), this appears not to homogenize the phenotypes of the allopolyploids. This suggests the existence of strong ecological divergent selection that acts at particular loci, and is responsible for maintaining distinct allopolyploid species. Their distinct ecological preference has arisen from independently-derived allopolyploidy events involving the same diploid progenitor species. The strength of the ecological segregation seems to be sufficient to maintain species integrity in the face of gene flow.

Given their widespread distribution, possibilities for long-range dispersal and the success of both polyploids, we assume genetic drift isolating these species is likely to have been a minor force for these established allopolyploids in the recent past and the present.
