Light is emitted through the fiber and send to the imaging probe, which works like a modified Michaelson interferometer. The beam splitter sends light to the retro-reflecting prism (reference mirror) and the sample beam which is focused by the scanning objective before it interacts with the coral tissue. Reflective boundaries within the coral tissue (white lines) scatter light back to the imaging probe where, reference light and sample light are combined and send to the spectrometer. A diffraction creating creates a characteristic spectral interferogram (Fourier-domain signal), which is converted to an OCT depth profile of reflectivity along the z-axis (A-scan) via Fourier transform. Two-dimensional (OCT B-scan) and three-dimensional (OCT C-scan) tomographs are sampled by moving the sample beam within the imaging probe along the x and y axis by a galvanometer system.",

Incident irradiance was either diffuse or collimated (top yellow arrows) and supplied the sediments with the incoming energy flux, JIN (solid yellow arrow). A fraction of the incoming light energy was reflected from the surface and thereby not a part of the absorbed light energy (JABS). Through multiple scattering by biotic and abiotic components in the biofilm/sediment, the light field becomes increasingly diffuse with depth. The absorbed light energy is either photochemically conserved in photosynthesis (JPS) in the photic zone or dissipated as heat (JH) via radiative energy transfer and non-photochemical quenching leading to local heating in the biofilm/sediment (red line). Gross photosynthesis (blue bars) is dependent on light and is thus higher near the surface which drives a production of O2 (blue line) that exceeds the consumption via respiration and leads to the formation of a diffusive boundary layer (DBL). The surplus of O2, i.e., the net photosynthesis, can be calculated as the sum of the upwards (J) and downwards (J) flux of O2 from the photic zone. Similarly, the fraction of the absorbed energy that is dissipated as heat can be calculated as the sum of upwards (J) and downwards (J) heat flux through the thermal boundary layer (TBL) into the overlaying water and into the aphotic sediment/biofilm layer, respectively.",

After mixing (stage 0), COCP is anchored by Apo-OCP (presumably, via NTE) (stage 1) and undergoes monomerization (critical stage 2) in order to transfer carotenoid into the NTD of Apo-OCP. Since the NTD has higher affinity to the carotenoid molecule than the CTD, it accepts the carotenoid from one of the CTD subunits of the anchored COCP. This leads to closure of OCP with bound carotenoid into the compact OCPO-like structure (stage 3) stabilized by carotenoid (stage 4). Efficiency of carotenoid transfer is high, and over 70% of carotenoid from COCP is transmitted to the orange photoactive form. However, as Apo-OCP tends to form homodimers at high concentrations, such structures could be stabilized by cross-domain carotenoid binding (confirmed by the data on Figure 4). Alternative pathway (right part) requires preliminary monomerization of COCP (effectively achieved by COCP-W288A mutant) or involvement of some other carotenoid carrier.",

All samples contained OCP and FRP (1/1.6 concentration ratio). The absence or low efficiency of excitation energy transfer (EET) in the red state could be at least partially explained by the changes of overlap integral between the Trp emission (donor) and ECN absorption (acceptor), which decreases due to the red shift of ECN absorption in the photoactivated state. Another reason could be the increased mobility of carotenoid molecule in the red state, which may lead to reduction of the role of (specific) orientation factors between Trp residues and the carotenoid. It should be noted that at least at low temperatures, the average Trp fluorescence lifetimes of OCPR are significantly larger compared to that of the OCP apoprotein (Apo-OCP) (), indicating that in this state quenching is not only removed, but that the carotenoid provides a hydrophobic environment for some Trp residues, which would shield them from collisional interactions with water compared to the situation in Apo-OCP. Previously it was shown that the largest solvent accessibility changes after photoconversion occurred in CAN binding residues, namely a decrease in solvent accessibility of Trp-41 (26).",

This indicates that some other effect limits the quenching at high concentrations of iodide. Since iodide anions belong to the group of chaotropes in the Hofmeister series, it is possible that high iodide concentrations induce slight (local) destabilizations of the protein structure, which could entail changes in the microenvironment of one or the other Trp residue.",

Absorption of a green photon by the dark-adapted OCPO (state 1) causes excitation and isomerization of the carotenoid molecule, which results in disruption of hydrogen bonds between the keto-group at the \u03b2-ring of the carotenoid and Trp-288 and Tyr-201, both located in the CTD of OCP (see ). The immediately appearing red intermediate OCPRI (state 2) is unstable and may rapidly (K ~ 300 \u03bcs-1, see ) return in to the initial orange state, as the protein structure of this red intermediate is similar to OCPO. However, carotenoid isomerization induces significant changes of the protein structure, which result in a significantly lower rate of red to orange transition, due to separation of structural domains in OCPR (stage 3). This relatively long-lived red state is physiologically active and can induce quenching of PBs fluorescence. Continuous illumination by actinic light causes accumulation of OCPR. However, even under continuous actinic illumination, dissipation of the red form occurs due to the following steps, which include carotenoid translocation into the CTD. This process occurs spontaneously most likely due to a high mobility of carotenoid in its hydrophobic cavity. In the wild-type OCP, this translocation may result in the reestablishment of hydrophobic interactions between one \u03b2-ring of the carotenoid and Trp-41 and Trp-101 in the NTD. Moreover, hydrogen bonds between the keto oxygen of the carotenoid and Tyr-201 and Trp-288 are formed, resulting in stabilization of the cofactor in the orange intermediate state OCPOI (stage 4), in which fluorescence of Trp-41, 101 and 208 is statically quenched, but the energy transfer to Trp-110 and Trp-277 is not yet established (see  and ). The latter is brought about by further rearrangement of the protein. The location of the carotenoid in the CTD is destabilized in the W288A mutant, so this sample is trapped between the stages 3 and 4, due to the presence of only one hydrogen bond between the carotenoid and Tyr-201. The presence of FRP or high concentration of phosphates increases the probability of intermediate OCPOI state formation. Absence of both Trp-288 and Tyr-201 traps the sample at stage 3.",

The presence of Flv proteins creates an electron sink and balances the surplus of the electron flow through PSI and PSII by delivering these electrons to oxygen, which is converted to water. The production of redox equivalents such as NADPH is maintained, resulting in the recycling of carbon through the Calvin-Benson cycle, which in turn generates an increased supply of the phosphorylated metabolites needed for starch synthesis. The energy required for this reaction is provided by ATP, which is synthesized in the PETC. The continuous flow of electrons results in the acidification of the lumen, which is the driving force for ATP synthesis. ATP is used for the conversion of Glc1P to ADPGlc via ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase. An increased availability of ADPGlc supports a higher level of starch synthesis; the starch accumulates when the leaf is exposed to light and is degraded during the dark phase.",

Dashed lines represent the value of the stability parameter, A, for CCMP452 (magenta) and CCMP3374 (orange). Shaded regions represent time windows over which a cell will be tumbled by turbulence (i.e., |\u03a9|A\u22121 > 1, Fig. S2A), corresponding in our experiments to imposed reorientations. During times when the rotation rate is within the two dashed lines (i.e., |\u03a9|A\u22121< 1), cells are not tumbled but will achieve an equilibrium swimming orientation (Fig. S1B), corresponding in our experiment to a resting time, \u03c4W, between reorientations. The cell\u2019s mechanical stability thus imposes a high-pass filter on the turbulent signal, with the higher mechanical stability of CCMP3374 resulting in longer resting times (Fig. S2B,C).

As a reference structure, we used the C2 Plankto-OCP-CAN (2 first rows), or either chain A or C of the P21 PlanktoOCP-CAN structure (third line). In each DDM, the lower and upper panels (separated by a sketch of the secondary structure) show the changes in C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distances for alternate conformers A and B with respect to the reference structure. Indeed, alternate conformations are seen in all Plankto-OCP structures. The overall similarity between upper and lower panels indicates that alternate conformations hardly affect the protein backbone. In the P21 crystals, two chains are found, which either display a more expanded (chain A) or a more compact (chain B) structure, due to changes in the opening angle between the NTD and the CTD. The DDM further indicates that these changes stem from helix \u03b1D, and the \u03b1C-\u03b1D and \u03b1G-\u03b1H loops, either drawing away (chain A) or coming closer (chain B) to the CTD, respectively. Comparison of the C2-CAN and C2-ECN structures suggests that the presence of CAN results in a more compact protein. Support to this hypothesis could not be obtained from comparison of the P21 chain A or P21 chain B structures. Nonetheless, we observe a similar trend when comparing, either in the CAN-functionalized or the ECN-functionalized states, P21 chain C and P21 chain A. Thus, changes in functionalizing carotenoid have a lesser influence on the OCP conformation than changes in space group. (B) DDM calculated for the isolated NTD of Syn-OCP-CAN vs. Syn-OCP-CAN.

In melanocytes, \u03b1MSH binds to and activates the G\u03b1s-coupled MC1R, leading to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and a transient increase in cAMP levels, which, through a series of molecular steps, leads to activation and upregulation of the microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF). MITF controls the expression of tyrosinase (TYR), the main melanogenic enzyme; higher MITF levels will result in more TYR that will generate a higher amount of melanin. Our data suggest that OPN3, via G\u03b1i activation, reduces the amount of cAMP generated by MC1R activation, causing decreased transcription of MITF and, in consequence, of TYR.
